\section{State of the art}
\Glspl{crna} have emerged as significant players in the
molecular landscape of breast cancer, particularly in relation to estrogen
signaling and tumor progression.
These \glspl{ncrna} are generated through back-splicing and have been
implicated in various cellular processes, including the regulation of gene
expression and the modulation of signaling pathways associated with cancer
development\supercite{li_circrna-sfmbt2_2023,tran_new_2020}.
The dysregulation of \glspl{crna} has been observed in breast cancer, where
they can act as \glspl{cerna}, sponging \glspl{mirna} and thereby influencing
the expression of target \glspl{mrna} involved in critical pathways such as
\gls{er} signaling\supercite{nair_circular_2016,xu_circrna_2022}.

\subsection{\Glsfmtshortpl{crna} in breast cancer}
Recent studies have highlighted specific \glspl{crna} that are associated with
breast cancer subtypes and their clinical implications.
For instance, \gls{crna}-SFMBT2 has been shown to orchestrate \gls{er}\textalpha{}
activation, contributing to \gls{tam} resistance in breast cancer cells,
thereby underscoring the role of \glspl{crna} in therapeutic
resistance\supercite{li_circrna-sfmbt2_2023}.
Additionally, \glspl{crna} such as circTADA2As and circFBXL5 have been
identified as regulators of \glspl{mirna} that target key signaling pathways,
including the SOCS3 and MAPK/ERK pathways, which are crucial for cell
proliferation and metastasis in breast
cancer\supercite{xu_circtada2as_2019,gao_hsa_circrna_0006528_2019}.
This suggests that \glspl{crna} not only participate in the pathogenesis of
breast cancer but also serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and
prognosis\supercite{liu_influence_2021,chen_circepsti1_2018}.

\subsection{\Glsfmtshortpl{crna} and estrogen signaling}
The interaction between \glspl{crna} and estrogen signaling is particularly
noteworthy.
Research has demonstrated that \gls{er+} breast cancer subtypes exhibit
specific \gls{crna} expression profiles that overlap with genes involved in
estrogen signaling pathways\supercite{nair_circular_2016}.
For example, \gls{crna}-000911 has been shown to suppress breast cancer cell
proliferation and invasion by sponging miR-449a, which in turn activates the
Notch1 signaling pathway, a known mediator of estrogen
signaling\supercite{wang_comprehensive_2018}.
Furthermore, the \gls{crna}-\gls{mirna}-\gls{mrna} regulatory networks
constructed in various studies have revealed that \glspl{crna} can modulate the
expression of genes related to estrogen response, oxidative stress, and
epigenetic modifications, thereby influencing tumor behavior and patient
outcomes\supercite{xu_circrna_2022,nair_circular_2016}.
