\label{sec:nf-core_circrna}
The \gls{nf-circrna} pipeline has originally been published by
\textcite{digby_nf-corecircrna_2023}.
Since then, the pipeline has gone through several updates and improvements.
The pipeline can utilize seven different tools for \gls{bsj} detection,
including \gls{ciriquant}, \gls{cex2}, \gls{circfinder}, \gls{dcc},
\gls{findcirc}, \gls{mapsplice}, and \gls{segemehl}.
It then annotates the detected \glspl{crna} using \gls{gtf}-based and
database-based annotation.
The pipeline also extracts the sequences of the \glspl{crna} and quantifies
their expression levels together with the linear transcripts.
Features not used in this study have been omitted in this explanation.
A complete overview of \gls{nf-circrna} is shown in
\cref{fig:circrna_pipeline}.
