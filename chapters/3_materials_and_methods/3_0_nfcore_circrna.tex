\label{sec:nf-core_circrna}
The nf-core/circrna pipeline has originally been published by Digby et al.
in
2023 \supercite{digby_nf-corecircrna_2023}.
Since then, the pipeline has gone through several updates and improvements.
The pipeline can utilize seven different tools for \gls{bsj} detection,
including CIRIquant, CIRCexplorer2, \gls{crna} finder, DCC, find\_circ,
MapSplice, and Segemehl.
It then annotates the detected \gls{crna}s using GTF-based and database-based
annotation.
The pipeline also extracts the sequences of the \gls{crna}s and quantifies
their expression levels together with the linear transcripts.
Finally, the pipeline performs \gls{mirna} interaction analysis using miRanda and
TargetScan, and provides several downstream analyses through a Shiny
application.
An overview of the pipeline is shown in \cref{fig:circrna_pipeline}.
