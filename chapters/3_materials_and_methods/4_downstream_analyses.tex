\section{Downstream analyses}

\subsection{Differential expression analysis}

Multiple studies used aggregations of the counts of reads supporting a
\gls{bsj} from multiple detection tools followed by differential expression
analysis using traditional tools like DESeq2\supercite{love_moderated_2014} and
EdgeR\supercite{robinson_edger_2010}
\supercite{digby_nf-corecircrna_2023,gaffo_sensitive_2022}.

This approach has recently been improved by \textcite{buratin_detecting_2022},
who implemented a generalized linear mixed model approach which can handle the
count information from multiple detection tools, without the need for prior
aggregation\supercite{digby_computational_2024}.
However, this approach is not yet implemented as an easy-to-use tool and was
thus not used in this study.

Add description of DESeq2.

\subsubsection{\Glsfmtlong{ciriquant}}

While \gls{ciriquant} is primarily a quantification tool, it also provides a
differential expression analysis feature.
While it lacks the flexibility of DESeq2 (e.g., in terms of design matrix
specification and tests for association with numeric covariates), it was
specifically designed for \gls{crna} data.
