\chapter{Results and Discussion}

For the results shown in this chapter, the raw sequencing data from the studies
mentioned in \cref{sec:datasets} were processed using the \gls{nf-circrna}
pipeline introduced in \cref{sec:nf-core_circrna}.
The mm39 reference genome was used for the alignment of the reads.
The pipeline was primarily run with the default settings, deviations will be
mentioned in the respective sections.
