\chapter{Results and Discussion}

For full analysis of \glspl{crna}, it is necessary to identify their
full-length sequences.
To reconstruct the full \gls{crna} sequence, a de novo assembly of the circular
transcriptome that accounts for \glspl{bsj} is necessary.
Tools like CIRI-full, \gls{crna}full, JCcirc, and psirc can achieve this, but
they rely on paired-end or long-read sequencing data.
As of now, no tools are available for de novo assembly of \glspl{crna} using
single-end short-read data, to my knowledge.
Since the data used in this thesis is single-end, the focus will be limited to
the detection, quantification, and analysis of \glspl{bsj}.
