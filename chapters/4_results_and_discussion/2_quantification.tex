\section{Quantification}

As mentioned in \cref{sec:crna_quantification}, all the \gls{bsj} detection
tools also quantify the number of reads supporting each \gls{bsj}.
However, there are several tools that focus on the quantification of
\gls{crna}s based on previously detected \gls{bsj}s.
nf-core/circrna offers two such tools:
CIRIquant
and psirc-quant.

In the following, I will compare the quantification results obtained by
the detection tools to those obtained by CIRIquant and psirc-quant.
