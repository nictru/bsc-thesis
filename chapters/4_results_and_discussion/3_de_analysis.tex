\section{Differential expression analysis}
Differential expression analysis was performed using the methods described in
\cref{sec:material_dea}: DESeq2 and \gls{ciriquant}.
In the following sections of this chapter, the results of the differential
expression analysis are presented.

\subsection{\Glspl{crna} associated with estrogen receptor expression}

In order to identify potential markers of estrogen levels, the expression of
the \gls{esr1} gene (described in \cref{sec:esr1}) was used as a proxy.
As \gls{ciriquant} does not support the differential expression along a
continuous variable, only the results obtained using DESeq2 are presented here.
As shown in \cref{fig:esr1_volcano}, the differential expression analysis
revealed a large number of \glspl{crna} significantly associated with the
expression of \gls{esr1}.
The functional enrichment analysis of the host genes of these \glspl{crna} is
shown in \cref{fig:esr1_go_terms}.

        Expression of the \gls{esr1} gene was determined using the nf-core/rnaseq
        pipeline\supercite{patel_nf-corernaseq_2024}.
        The following design formula was used: $\sim age + transgene + induction + drug
            + esr1$.
        The expression matrix containing all samples was tested for log2 fold changes
        with greater absolute values than 2.
        Benjamini-Hochberg correction\supercite{benjamini_controlling_1995} was used to
        adjust the $p$-values for multiple testing.
        \Glspl{crna} were considered significantly associated with \gls{esr1}
        expression if they had an adjusted $p$-value of less than 0.05.

When looking at the result of the functional enrichment analysis, one has to
keep in mind that the expression of \glspl{crna} is not necessarily directly
linked to the expression of the host gene.
Furthermore \glspl{crna} might have a different function than their respective
host genes.

However, the results show that there are many \glspl{crna} that both originate
from host genes with a functional relation to estrogen and show a significant
association with the expression of \gls{esr1}.

In the following paragraphs I will discuss some of the most interesting GO
terms that were found in the functional enrichment analysis.

\paragraph{Developmental growth}
The GO term \textit{developmental growth} is associated with the growth of a
whole organism, a part of an organism, or a
cell\supercite{noauthor_quickgodevelopmental_nodate,binns_quickgo_2009}.
As discussed in \cref{sec:estrogen_signaling}, estrogen is known to promote
cell proliferation and differentiation in the breast tissue and other organs.
Thus, it is not surprising that the host genes of \glspl{crna} associated with
\gls{esr1} expression are enriched for this term.

\paragraph{Kinase binding}
Kinase binding is another area where estrogen receptors exert influence.
Estrogen receptors can interact with various kinases, which are essential for
signal transduction pathways that regulate cell proliferation and survival.
For instance, the activation of \gls{era} has been shown to involve the
phosphorylation of specific kinases, such as p38 MAPK, which is crucial for
mediating estrogen's effects on gene expression\supercite{lee_regulation_2002}.
This interaction between \glspl{er} and kinases underscores the importance of
kinase signaling in the regulation of estrogen-responsive genes, thereby
linking kinase binding to the broader context of estrogen receptor
signaling\supercite{campbell_phosphatidylinositol_2001}.
Moreover, the role of kinases in modulating \gls{er} activity highlights their
significance in the regulation of cell cycle processes and cellular
growth\supercite{lu_regulation_2003}.

\paragraph{Mitotic cell cycle and regulation of cell cycle process}
The mitotic cell cycle and its regulation are closely tied to estrogen receptor
signaling.
Estrogen has been shown to promote cell cycle progression, particularly in
hormone-responsive tissues.
The interaction of \glspl{er} with cell cycle regulators facilitates the
transition through various phases of the cell cycle, particularly in breast
cancer cells where \gls{era} is a key
player\supercite{drabovich_dynamics_2016}.
The regulation of genes involved in the cell cycle by estrogen underscores the
importance of ERs in maintaining proper cellular proliferation and
function\supercite{bjornstrom_mechanisms_2005}.
Additionally, studies have demonstrated that estrogen can induce the expression
of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, which are critical for cell cycle
progression, further linking \gls{er} expression to the regulation of the cell
cycle\supercite{g_widespread_2009}.
