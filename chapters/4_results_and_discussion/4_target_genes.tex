\section{Target gene analysis}

As discussed in \cref{sec:circrna_functions}, \glspl{crna} can act as
\gls{mirna} sponges and regulate the expression of target genes.
In order to investigate this regulatory mechanism, the \gls{nf-circrna}
pipeline was used to predict interactions between differentially expressed
\glspl{crna} and \glspl{mirna} that are known to be active in mouse mammary
tissue.
The dataset introduced in \cref{sec:mirna_data} was used for this analysis.
It provides a list of identified \glspl{mirna} and the target genes they are
predicted to regulate.

For each of the differentially expressed \glspl{crna}, the pipeline predicted
potential interactions with \glspl{mirna} based on sequence complementarity and
binding energy calculations.
For each \gls{crna}, the target genes of all \glspl{mirna} it interacts with
were aggregated to a single list of potential \gls{crna} target genes.
Then, gene set enrichment analysis was performed to identify biological
processes and pathways that are significantly enriched among the predicted
target genes.
