\section{circRNAs}
This section describes what circRNAs are, how they are formed, and what their functions are.
It also gives insights into the current state of research.

\subsection{Biogenesis}
During standard gene expression, pre-mRNA is transcribed from DNA.
Splicing then removes introns and joins exons to produce mature mRNA \supercite{black_mechanisms_2003}.
In conventional splicing, an upstream 5' splice site (donor) connects to a downstream 3' splice site (acceptor), forming linear mRNA (\cref{fig:circRNA_splicing}a).
Conversely, for circRNAs, a downstream 5' splice site connects to an upstream 3' splice site in reverse order across at least one exon \supercite{chen_expanding_2020}.
This backsplicing process creates a circular RNA molecule (\cref{fig:circRNA_splicing}b).

Introns excised during conventional splicing typically form a lariat shape, which is usually debranched and degraded shortly after splicing (\cref{fig:circRNA_splicing}a).
However, some introns avoid debranching and instead form covalent circular RNA molecules (\cref{fig:circRNA_splicing}c).
These are known as circular-intronic RNAs (ciRNAs) \supercite{chen_expanding_2020,zhang_circular_2013}.
