\section{Outline}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe role of breast cancer in modern health care
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Abundance
              \item Outcomes
          \end{itemize}
    \item Describe current methods for diagnosis and treatment
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Gene panels for risk-assessment of already detected tumors
              \item Shortage of methods for detecting tumors on a molecular basis
                    (need to do more research here)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Describe how circRNAs can improve diagnosis and treatment quality
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Short description of circRNA structure
              \item Increased stability compared to linear RNA biomarkers
              \item Regulatory roles, potential drug targets
              \item Help understanding how well existing treatment methods work
                    (Letrozole, Tamoxifen)
          \end{itemize}
    \item Describe how this thesis approaches the investigation of circRNAs
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Not sure how much detail is necessary here, and how much should
                    be left for materials and methods
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
