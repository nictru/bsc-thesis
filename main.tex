\documentclass[
  a4paper,            % paper size (a4paper, a5paper)
  thesis=student,     % define the type of the thesis (student, phd, none)
  english,            % define the document language (english, german)
  % BCOR=5mm,           % define a binding offset for the document
  % coverBCOR=1cm,      % define a different binding offset for the cover page
  % coverpage=false,    % disable the cover page (e.g. if a tumcover is used)
  % titlepage=false,    % disable the additional title page
  % oneside,            % use onesided or twosided layout (oneside, twoside)
  % headmarks=true,     % enable headmarks (true, false)
  % font=times          % define main text font (helvet, times, palatino, libertine)

% For theses that are printed with a transparent cover it is recommended to
% use the coverpage and provide the proper coverBCOR, so the distance between
% the binding strip and the content is properly set to 1 * logoheight.
% In this case, the publisher and titleback information is most certainly
% empty and the titlepage may be turned off.
%
% For theses that are printed with a soft cover or by a publisher it is
% recommended to create a cover using the tumcover class and therefore turn
% off the coverpage here. In this case, you most certainly have publisher and
% titleback information and you should keep the titlepage option enabled.
