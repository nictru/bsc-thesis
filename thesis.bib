	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNA molecules formed by joining a downstream 3 splice donor site and an upstream 5 splice acceptor site. Several recent studies have identified circRNAs as potential biomarker for different diseases. A number of methods are available for the identification of circRNAs. The circRNA identification methods cannot provide full-length sequences. Reconstruction of the full-length sequences is crucial for the downstream analyses of circRNA research including differential expression analysis, circRNA-miRNA interaction analysis and other functional studies of the circRNAs. However, a limited number of methods are available in the literature for the reconstruction of full-length circRNA sequences. We developed a new method, circRNA-full, for full-length circRNA sequence reconstruction utilizing chimeric alignment information from the STAR aligner. To evaluate our method, we used full-length circRNA sequences produced by isocirc and ciri-long using long-reads RNA-seq data. Our method achieved better reconstruction rate, precision, sensitivity and F1 score than the existing full-length circRNA sequence reconstruction tool ciri-full for both human and mouse data.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shed light on the potential of circular RNA (circRNA) as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and as a nucleic acid vaccine. The exploration of these functionalities requires correct circRNA full-length sequences; however, existing assembly tools can only correctly assemble some circRNAs, and their performance can be further improved. Here, we introduce a novel feature known as the junction contig (JC), which is an extension of the back-splice junction (BSJ). Leveraging the strengths of both BSJ and JC, we present a novel method called JCcirc (https://github.com/cbbzhang/JCcirc). It enables efficient reconstruction of all types of circRNA full-length sequences and their alternative isoforms using splice graphs and fragment coverage. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of JCcirc over existing methods on human simulation datasets, and its average F1 score surpasses CircAST by 0.40 and outperforms both CIRI-full and circRNAfull by 0.13. For circRNAs below 400 bp, 400–800 bp, 800 bp–1200 bp and above 1200 bp, the correct assembly rates are 0.13, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03 higher, respectively, than those achieved by existing methods. Moreover, JCcirc also outperforms existing assembly tools on other five model species datasets and real sequencing datasets. These results show that JCcirc is a robust tool for accurately assembling circRNA full-length sequences, laying the foundation for the functional analysis of circRNAs.},

We showed the functionality of the circRNA-sponging pipeline using RNA sequencing data from brain tissues, where we identified two distinct types of circRNAs characterized by a specific ratio of the number of the binding site to the length of the transcript. The circRNA-sponging pipeline is the first end-to-end pipeline to identify circRNAs and their sponging systematically with raw total RNA-seq and miRNA-seq files, allowing us to better indicate the functional impact of circRNAs as a routine aspect in transcriptomic research.https://github.com/biomedbigdata/circRNA-sponging.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

Finally, we evaluated the effect of circTADA2A-E6 on miR-203a-3p and its target gene SOCS3. We detected two circRNAs, circTADA2A-E6 and circTADA2A-E5/E6, which were among the top five differentially expressed circRNAs in breast cancer. They were consistently and significantly decreased in a large cohort of breast cancer patients, and their downregulation was associated with poor patient survival for TNBC. Especially, circTADA2A-E6 suppressed in vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity and possessed tumor-suppressor capability. circTADA2A-E6 preferentially acted as a miR-203a-3p sponge to restore the expression of miRNA target gene SOCS3, resulting in a less aggressive oncogenic phenotype. circTADA2As as promising prognostic biomarkers in TNBC patients, and therapeutic targeting of circTADA2As/miRNA/mRNA network may be a potential strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.},

To investigate the regulatory effect of circRPPH1 on cellular behaviors of breast cancer and the potential mechanism, the expression of circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p in breast cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The regulatory effects of the circRPPH1/miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis on cellular behaviors of breast cancer cells were evaluated through functional experiments in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The relationship between circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p/YAP1 was assessed using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. PCR results showed that circRPPH1 levels were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and breast cancer cells. Functionally, circRPPH1 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cell lines and tumor growth in vivo. Regarding the mechanism, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays showed that circRPPH1 was capable of sponging miR-556-5p to increase expression of the oncogene YAP1. Our data reveal that circRPPH1 plays a vital regulatory role in breast cancer via the miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs are a large group of noncoding RNAs that are widely expressed in mammalian cells. Genome-wide analyses have revealed abundant and evolutionarily conserved circular RNAs across species, which suggest specific physiological roles of these species. Using a microarray approach, we detected increased expression of a circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 in eight breast cancer cell lines and in patients with breast carcinoma. Silencing circ-Dnmt1 inhibited cell proliferation and survival. Ectopic circ-Dnmt1 increased the proliferative and survival capacities of breast cancer cells by stimulating cellular autophagy. We found that circ-Dnmt1-mediated autophagy was essential in inhibiting cellular senescence and increasing tumor xenograft growth. We further found that ectopically expressed circ-Dnmt1 could interact with both p53 and AUF1, promoting the nuclear translocation of both proteins. Nuclear translocation of p53 induced cellular autophagy while AUF1 nuclear translocation reduced Dnmt1 mRNA instability, resulting in increased Dnmt1 translation. From here, functional Dnmt1 could then translocate into the nucleus, inhibiting p53 transcription. Computational algorithms revealed that both p53 and AUF1 could bind to different regions of circ-Dnmt1 RNA. Our results showed that the highly expressed circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 could bind to and regulate oncogenic proteins in breast cancer cells. Thus circ-Dnmt1 appears to be an oncogenic circular RNA with potential for further preclinical research.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently identified class of RNAs produced via back-splicing and covalent linkage between RNA ends, resulting in a circularized RNA molecule. Physiologically, circRNAs are known to influence a variety of biological pathways, and can also regulate transcription, post-transcription, RNA splicing, or interaction with other proteins or microRNAs (miRNAs). Functionally, circRNAs are known to competitively bind to various other RNA molecules including miRNAs and other competing endogenous RNA such as long noncoding RNA, thereby significantly influencing gene expression. Since gene expression is a crucial factor that underlies economically important livestock traits, it is likely that circRNAs significantly influence livestock traits like growth, milk production, reproduction, meat quality, hair follicle growth, and gametogenesis. Thousands of circRNAs have been recognized in different species of animals, and some of these circRNAs have also been shown to regulate stress responses that may be crucial for animal welfare. Therefore, in this review, we aim to highlight the biogenesis of circRNAs, along with its potential implications for livestock. The presented summary would offer a fundamental understanding of the molecular machinery that underlies circRNAs and associated biological phenomena and emphasize the need for further explorations into the role of circRNAs in the other productive, reproductive, and physiological attributes in animals.},

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the most common pathogens of mastitis in dairy cows and usually cause subclinical or clinical mastitis. CircRNAs and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) play important roles in immunological diseases. However, the mechanisms by which m6A modifies circRNA in bovine mammary epithelial cells remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate m6A-modified circRNAs in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) injured by S. aureus and E. coli. The profile of m6A-modified circRNA showed a total of 1,599 m6A peaks within 1,035 circRNAs in the control group, 35 peaks within 32 circRNAs in the S. aureus group, and 1,016 peaks within 728 circRNAs in the E. coli group. Compared with the control group, 67 peaks within 63 circRNAs were significantly different in the S. aureus group, and 192 peaks within 137 circRNAs were significantly different in the E. coli group. Furthermore, we found the source genes of these differentially m6A-modified circRNAs in the S. aureus and E. coli groups with similar functions according to GO and KEGG analyses, which were mainly associated with cell injury, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. CircRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction networks predicted the potential circRNA regulation mechanism in S. aureus- and E. coli-induced cell injury. We found that the mRNAs in the networks, such as BCL2, MIF, and TNFAIP8L2, greatly participated in the MAPK, WNT, and inflammation pathways. This is the first report on m6A-modified circRNA regulation of cells under S. aureus and E. coli treatment, and sheds new light on potential mechanisms and targets from the perspective of epigenetic modification in mastitis and other inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {Bovine mastitis is an inflammatory response of mammary glands caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). As a key virulence factor of E. coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses via activation of the toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. However, the molecular regulatory network of LPS-induced bovine mastitis has yet to be fully mapped. In this study, bovine mammary epithelial cell lines MAC-T were exposed to LPS for 0, 6 and 12 h to assess the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were filtered out of the raw data for subsequent analyses. A total of 2,257 lncRNAs, including 210 annotated and 2047 novel lncRNAs were detected in all samples. A large proportion of lncRNAs were present in a high abundance, and 112 DElncRNAs were screened out at different time points. Compared with 0 h, there were 22 up- and 25 down-regulated lncRNAs in the 6 h of post-infection (hpi) group, and 27 up- and 22 down-regulated lncRNAs in the 12 hpi group. Compared with the 6 hpi group, 32 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 25 lncRNAs were down-regulated in the 12 hpi group. These DElncRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of immune-related processes including inflammatory responses bMECs exposed to LPS. Furthermore, lncRNA TCONS\_00039271 and TCONS\_00139850 were respectively significance down- and up-regulated, and their target genes involve in regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways (i.e.,Notch, NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K-Akt and mTOR signaling pathway), thereby regulating the occurrence and development of E. coli mastitis. This study provides a resource for lncRNA research on the molecular regulation of bovine mastitis},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that the occurrence and development of tumours are associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the expression profile and clinical significance of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours remain unclear. In this paper, we collected tissue samples from three dogs with canine mammary tumours and analysed the expression profiles of circRNAs in these samples using high-throughput sequencing technology. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses revealed 14 biological processes associated with these genes, and 11 of these genes were selected for qRT-PCR to verify their authenticity. CircRNAs have sponge adsorption to miRNAs, so we constructed a circRNA-miRNA network map using Cytoscape software. As a result, we identified a total of 14,851 circRNAs in canine mammary tumours and its adjacent normal tissues. Of these, 106 were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.05), and 64 were upregulated and 42 were downregulated. The GO analysis revealed that the biological processes involved were mainly in the regulation of the secretory pathway, the regulation of neurotransmitter secretion and the positive regulation of phagocytosis. Most of these biological pathways were associated with the cGMP-PKG (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signalling pathway, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signalling pathway and the oxytocin signalling pathway. After screening, source genes closely associated with canine mammary tumours were found to include RYR2, PDE4D, ROCK2, CREB3L2 and UBA3, and associated circRNAs included chr27:26618544-26687235-, chr26:8194880-8201833+ and chr17:7960861-7967766-. In conclusion, we reveals the expression profile of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours. In addition, some circRNAs might be used as potential biomarkers for molecular diagnosis.},

By constructing pseudo-circular reference for re-alignment of RNA-seq reads and employing sophisticated statistical models to correct RNase R treatment biases, CIRIquant can provide more accurate expression values for circRNAs with significantly reduced false discovery rate. We further develop a one-stop differential expression analysis pipeline implementing two independent measures, which helps unveil the regulation of competitive splicing between circRNAs and their linear counterparts. We apply CIRIquant to RNA-seq datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma, and characterize two important groups of linear-circular switching and circular transcript usage switching events, which demonstrate the promising ability to explore extensive transcriptomic changes in liver tumorigenesis.},

Circular RNAs are a recently identified group of non-coding RNA with a significant role in disease development with potential utility in diagnosis/prognosis in cancer. In this study, we identified 26 differentially expressed circular RNAs associated with early-stage breast cancer. RNA sequencing and two circRNA detection tools (find\_circ and DCC) were used to understand the circRNA expression signature in breast cancer. We identified hsa\_circ\_0006743 (circJMJD1C) and hsa\_circ\_0002496 (circAPPBP1) to be significantly up-regulated in early-stage breast cancer tissues. Co-expression analysis identified four pairs of circRNA-miRNA (hsa\_circ\_0023990 : hsa-miR-548b-3p, hsa\_circ\_0016601 : hsa\_miR-1246, hsa\_circ\_0001946 : hsa-miR-1299 and hsa\_circ\_0000117:hsa-miR-502-5p) having potential interaction. The miRNA target prediction and network analysis revealed mRNA possibly regulated by circRNAs. We have thus identified circRNAs of diagnostic implications in breast cancer and also observed circRNA-miRNA interaction which could be involved in breast cancer development.},

Over the past years, due to their intrinsic stability and resistance to ribonucleases, particular attention has been drawn to their use as reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. However, there are some critical caveats to their utility in the clinic. Their circular shape limits their annotation and a complete functional elucidation is lacking.

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel type of endogenous RNAs, have become a subject of intensive research. It has been found that circRNAs are important players in cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis, as well as disease development. Moreover, the expression of circRNAs is usually not correlated with their parental gene expression, indicating that they are not only a steady-state by-product of mRNA splicing but a product of variable splicing under novel regulation. Sequence conservation analysis has also demonstrated that circRNAs have important non-coding functions. CircRNAs exist as a covalently closed loop form in mammalian cells, where they regulate cellular transcription and translation processes. CircRNAs are built from pre-messenger RNAs, and their biogenesis involves back-splicing, which is catalyzed by spliceosomes. The splicing reaction gives rise to three different types of intronic, exotic and exon–intron circular RNAs. Due to higher nuclease stability and longer half lives in cells, circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs and have enormous clinical advantage for use as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for disease. In recent years, it has been reported that circRNAs in stem cells play a crucial role in stem cell function. In this article, we reviewed the general feature of circRNAs and the distinct roles of circRNAs in stem cell biology, including regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. CircRNAs have shown unique expression profiles during differentiation of stem cells and could serve as promising biomarkers of these cells. As circRNAs play pivotal roles in stem cell regulation as well as the development and progression of various diseases, we also discuss opportunities and challenges of circRNA-based treatment strategies in future effective therapies for promising clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules that have been linked to various diseases, including cancer. However, a precise function and working mechanism are lacking for the larger majority. Following many different experimental and computational approaches to identify circRNAs, multiple circRNA databases were developed as well. Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the current circRNA databases, which substantially hamper progression in the field. First, as the overlap in content is limited, a true reference set of circRNAs is lacking. This results from the low abundance and highly specific expression of circRNAs, and varying sequencing methods, data-analysis pipelines, and circRNA detection tools. A second major issue is the use of ambiguous nomenclature. Thus, redundant or even conflicting names for circRNAs across different databases contribute to the reproducibility crisis. Third, circRNA databases, in essence, rely on the position of the circRNA back-splice junction, whereas alternative splicing could result in circRNAs with different length and sequence. To uniquely identify a circRNA molecule, the full circular sequence is required. Fourth, circRNA databases annotate circRNAs’ microRNA binding and protein-coding potential, but these annotations are generally based on presumed circRNA sequences. Finally, several databases are not regularly updated, contain incomplete data or suffer from connectivity issues. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current circRNA databases and their content, features, and usability. In addition to discussing the current issues regarding circRNA databases, we come with important suggestions to streamline further research in this growing field.},

	abstract = {Thousands of eukaryotic protein-coding genes generate circular RNAs that have covalently linked ends and are resistant to degradation by exonucleases. To prove their circularity as well as biochemically enrich these transcripts, it has become standard in the field to use the 3′-5′ exonuclease RNase R. Here, we demonstrate that standard protocols involving RNase R can fail to digest \&gt;20\% of all highly expressed linear RNAs, but these shortcomings can largely be overcome. RNAs with highly structured 3′ ends, including snRNAs and histone mRNAs, are naturally resistant to RNase R, but can be efficiently degraded once a poly(A) tail has been added to their ends. In addition, RNase R stalls in the body of many polyadenylated mRNAs, especially at G-rich sequences that have been previously annotated as G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Upon replacing K+ (which stabilizes G4s) with Li+ in the reaction buffer, we find that RNase R is now able to proceed through these sequences and fully degrade the mRNAs in their entirety. In total, our results provide important improvements to the current methods used to isolate circular RNAs as well as a way to reveal RNA structures that may naturally inhibit degradation by cellular exonucleases.},

In metazoans, circular RNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, are highly stable, and accumulate with age in neural tissues. circRNA biogenesis can regulate the production of the linear RNA counterpart in cis as back-splicing competes with linear splicing. Recent reports also demonstrate functions for some circRNAs in trans: Certain circRNAs interact with microRNAs, some are translated, and circRNAs have been shown to regulate immune responses and behavior. Here, we review current knowledge about animal circRNAs and summarize new insights into potential circRNA functions, concepts of their origin, and possible future directions in the field.},

	abstract = {A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test.},

These observations have sparked great interest into this class of previously underappreciated RNAs and prompted the development of new experimental approaches to study them, especially methods to measure or modulate circular RNA expression levels. Nonetheless, each of these approaches has caveats and potential pitfalls that must be controlled for when designing experiments and interpreting results. Here, we provide practical advice, tips, and suggested guidelines for performing robust identification, validation, and functional characterization of circular RNAs.

In sheep, little is known about the role of circular RNAs in mammary gland tissue, and therefore an RNA sequencing approach was used to compare mammary gland tissue expression of circular RNAs in 9 Small Tail Han sheep at peak lactation, and subsequently when they were not lactating. These 9 sheep had their RNA pooled for analysis into 3 libraries from peak lactation and 3 from the nonlactating period. A total of 3,278 and 1,756 circular RNAs were identified in the peak lactation and nonlactating mammary gland tissues, respectively, and the expression and identity of 9 of them was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and DNA sequencing. The type, chromosomal location and length of the circular RNAs identified were ascertained. Forty upregulated and one downregulated circular RNAs were characterized in the mammary gland tissue at peak lactation compared with the nonlactating mammary gland tissue. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the parental genes of these differentially expressed circular RNAs were related to molecular function, binding, protein binding, ATP binding, and ion binding. Five differentially expression circular RNAs were selected for further analysis to predict their target microRNAs, and some microRNAs reportedly associated with the development of the mammary gland were found in the constructed circular RNA–microRNA network. This study reveals the expression profiles and characterization of circular RNAs at 2 key stages of mammary gland activity, thereby providing an improved understanding of the roles of circular RNAs in the mammary gland of sheep.},

Here we identified a circular RNA, circBtnl1, that is highly expressed in ISCs. Loss of circBtnl1 in mice enhanced ISC self‐renewal capacity and epithelial regeneration, without changes in mRNA and protein levels of its parental gene Btnl1. Mechanistically, circBtnl1 and Atf4 mRNA competitively bound the ATP‐dependent RNA helicase Ddx3y to impair the stability of Atf4 mRNA in wild‐type ISCs. Furthermore, ATF4 activated Sox9 transcription by binding to its promoter via a unique motif, to enhance the self‐renewal capacity and epithelial regeneration of ISCs. In contrast, circBtnl1 knockout promoted Atf4 mRNA stability and enhanced ATF4 expression, which caused Sox9 transcription to potentiate ISC stemness. These data indicate that circBtnl1‐mediated Atf4 mRNA decay suppresses Sox9 transcription that negatively modulates self‐renewal maintenance of ISCs., A newly identified circRNA, CircBtnl1 inhibits the self‐renewal of mouse intestinal stem cells through indirect suppression of Sox9 activity.},

Importantly, circRNAs have been shown to participate in regulating various biological processes. Functionally, circRNAs can influence cellular physiology through various molecular mechanisms, such as serving as a decoy for microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins to modulate gene expression or translation of regulatory proteins. The biogenesis of circRNAs is known to be tightly regulated by cis- (intronic complementary sequences) and/or trans-factors (splicing factors) that constitute a cell- and context-dependent regulatory layer in the control of gene expression. However, our understanding of the regulation and function of circRNAs is still limited. In this review, we summarize the current progress in elucidating the functional roles, mechanisms and biogenesis of circRNAs.

However, it remains unknown what regulates the biogenesis of these ORF-containing circRNAs, whether they are actually translated into proteins and what functions they play in specific physiological contexts. Here, we report that a large number of circRNAs are synthesized with increasing abundance when late pachytene spermatocytes develop into round and then elongating spermatids during murine spermatogenesis. For a subset of circRNAs, the back splicing appears to occur mostly at m6A-enriched sites, which are usually located around the start and stop codons in linear mRNAs. Consequently, approximately a half of these male germ cell circRNAs contain large ORFs with m6A-modified start codons in their junctions, features that have been recently shown to be associated with protein-coding potential. Hundreds of peptides encoded by the junction sequences of these circRNAs were detected using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, suggesting that these circRNAs can indeed be translated into proteins in both developing (spermatocytes and spermatids) and mature (spermatozoa) male germ cells. The present study discovered not only a novel role of m6A in the biogenesis of coding circRNAs, but also a potential mechanism to ensure stable and long-lasting protein production in the absence of linear mRNAs, i.e., through production of circRNAs containing large ORFs and m6A-modified start codons in junction sequences.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that, unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene regulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3′ and 5′ ends normally present in an RNA molecule have been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments. In addition, though originally thought to be non-coding, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that select circRNAs can be translated into functional proteins. Although much remains to be elucidated about circRNA biology and mechanisms of gene regulation, these ncRNAs are quickly emerging as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A circRNA is a type of endogenous noncoding RNA that consists of a closed circular RNA molecule formed by reverse splicing; these RNAs are widely distributed in a variety of biological cells. In contrast to linear RNAs, circRNAs have no 5′ cap or 3′ poly(A) tail. They have a stable structure, a high degree of conservation, and high stability, and they are richly and specifically expressed in certain tissues and developmental stages. CircRNAs play a very important role in the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. According to their origins, circRNAs can be divided into four types: exon-derived circRNAs (ecRNAs), intron-derived circRNAs (ciRNAs), circRNAs containing both exons and introns (EIciRNAs) and intergenic circRNAs. A large number of studies have shown that circRNAs have a variety of biological functions, participate in the regulation of gene expression and play an important role in the occurrence and progression of tumors. In this paper, the structure and function of circRNAs are reviewed, along with their biological role in malignant tumors of the digestive tract, in order to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of digestive system neoplasms.},

Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date, several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.},

The vast majority of circRNAs are found in the cytoplasm, and some intron-containing circRNAs are localized in the nucleus. CircRNAs have been found to function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interact with RBPs and translate proteins, and play an important regulatory role in the development and progression of cancer. CircRNAs exhibit tissue- and developmental stage–specific expression and are stable, with longer half-lives than linear RNAs. CircRNAs have great potential as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, which is highlighted by their detectability in tissues, especially in fluid biopsy samples such as plasma, saliva, and urine.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related death in the world, especially due to its frequency and ineffective therapeutically approaches in the late stages of the disease. Despite the recent advent of promising new targeted therapies, lung cancer diagnostic strategies still have difficulty in identifying the disease at an early stage. Therefore, the characterizations of more sensible and specific cancer biomarkers have become an important goal for clinicians. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of RNA with covalently closed continuous loop structures that display high structural resistance and tissue specificity pointed toward a potential biomarker role. Current investigations have identified that circRNAs have a prominent function in the regulation of oncogenic pathways, by regulating gene expression both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The aim of this review is to provide novel information regarding the implications of circRNAs in lung cancer, with an emphasis on the role in disease development and progression. Initially, we explored the potential utility of circRNAs as biomarkers, focusing on function, mechanisms, and correlation with disease progression in lung cancer. Further, we will describe the interaction between circRNAs and other non-coding species of RNA (particularly microRNA) and their biological significance in lung cancer. Describing the nature of these interactions and their therapeutic potential will provide additional insight regarding the altered molecular landscape of lung cancer and consolidate the potential clinical value of these circular transcripts.

CircRNAs have been shown to act as sponges for miRNAs and may also potentially sponge RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and are thus predicted to function as robust posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. The joint analysis of large-scale transcriptome data coupled with computational analyses represents a powerful approach to elucidate possible biological roles of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Here, we present a new web tool, CircInteractome (circRNA interactome), for mapping RBP- and miRNA-binding sites on human circRNAs. CircInteractome searches public circRNA, miRNA, and RBP databases to provide bioinformatic analyses of binding sites on circRNAs and additionally analyzes miRNA and RBP sites on junction and junction-flanking sequences. CircInteractome also allows the user the ability to (1) identify potential circRNAs which can act as RBP sponges, (2) design junction-spanning primers for specific detection of circRNAs of interest, (3) design siRNAs for circRNA silencing, and (4) identify potential internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES). In sum, the web tool CircInteractome, freely accessible at http://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov, facilitates the analysis of circRNAs and circRNP biology.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading malignant tumor in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its pathogenesis involves multiple factors, including environment, lifestyle, and genetics. Continuing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs), as a novel non-coding RNA, constitute an important genetic variable in the pathogenesis of CRC. These circRNAs with covalently closed-loop structures exist objectively in organisms. They not only have the biological functions of regulating the expression of target genes, changing the activity of proteins, and translating proteins, but also play a key role in the proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of tumor cells. CRC is one of the most common cancers in which circRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance, and circRNAs have been demonstrated to function through crosstalk with multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, this review summarizes the biological and carcinogenic functions of circRNAs and their related PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Notch, JAK/STAT, Hippo/YAP, WNT/β-catenin, and VEGF signaling pathways in CRC.

Sequence annotation suggests that most circRNAs are generated from splicing in reversed orders across exons. However, the mechanisms of this backsplicing are largely unknown. Here we constructed a single exon minigene containing split GFP, and found that the pre-mRNA indeed produces circRNA through efficient backsplicing in human and Drosophila cells. The backsplicing is enhanced by complementary introns that form double-stranded RNA structure to bring splice sites in proximity, but such structure is not required. Moreover, backsplicing is regulated by general splicing factors and cis-elements, but with regulatory rules distinct from canonical splicing. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. Unlike linear mRNA, poly-adenosine or poly-thymidine in 3′ UTR can inhibit circular mRNA translation. This study revealed that backsplicing can occur efficiently in diverse eukaryotes to generate circular mRNAs.},

The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations is found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs.,

We discover that consensus m6A motifs are enriched in circRNAs and a single m6A site is sufficient to drive translation initiation. This m6A-driven translation requires initiation factor eIF4G2 and m6A reader YTHDF3, and is enhanced by methyltransferase METTL3/14, inhibited by demethylase FTO, and upregulated upon heat shock. Further analyses through polysome profiling, computational prediction and mass spectrometry reveal that m6A-driven translation of circRNAs is widespread, with hundreds of endogenous circRNAs having translation potential.

First, we engineer a self-splicing intron to efficiently circularize a wide range of RNAs up to 5 kb in length in vitro by rationally designing ubiquitous accessory sequences that aid in splicing. We maximize translation of functional protein from these circRNAs in eukaryotic cells, and we find that engineered circRNA purified by high performance liquid chromatography displays exceptional protein production qualities in terms of both quantity of protein produced and stability of production. This study pioneers the use of exogenous circRNA for robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells and demonstrates that circRNA is a promising alternative to linear mRNA., Circular RNAs have recently been shown to have protein-coding potential.

They have been widely found in Populus euphratica Oliv. heteromorphic leaves (P. hl). To study the role of circRNAs related to transcription factors (TFs) in the morphogenesis of P. hl, the expression profiles of circRNAs in linear, lanceolate, ovate, and broad-ovate leaves of P. euphratica were elucidated by strand-specific sequencing. We identified and characterized 22 circRNAs related to TFs in P. hl at the four developmental stages. Using the competing endogenous RNAs hypothesis as a guide, we constructed circRNA–miRNA–TF mRNA regulatory networks, which indicated that circRNAs antagonized microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby influencing the expression of the miRNA target genes and playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Gene ontology annotation of the target TF genes predicted that these circRNAs were associated mainly with the regulation of leaf development, leaf morphogenesis, signal transduction, and response to abiotic stress. These findings implied that the circRNAs affected the size and number of cells in P. hl by regulating the expression of TF mRNAs.

However, our understanding of the prevalence of this modification has been fundamentally redefined by transcriptome-wide m6A mapping studies, which have shown that m6A is present in a large subset of the transcriptome in specific regions of mRNA. This suggests that mRNA may undergo post-transcriptional methylation to regulate its fate and function, analogous to methyl modifications in DNA. Thus, the pattern of methylation constitutes an mRNA ‘epitranscriptome’. The identification of adenosine methyltransferases (‘writers’), m6A demethylating enzymes (‘erasers’) and m6A binding proteins (‘readers’) is helping to define cellular pathways for the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs.},

This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric and adds another layer to the dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The stability of m6A-modified mRNA is regulated by an m6A reader protein, human YTHDF2, which recognizes m6A and reduces the stability of target transcripts. Looking at additional functional roles for the modification, we find that anotherm6A reader protein, human YTHDF1, actively promotes protein synthesis by interacting with translation machinery. In a unified mechanism of m6A-based regulation in the cytoplasm, YTHDF2-mediated degradation controls the lifetime of target transcripts, whereas YTHDF1-mediated translation promotion increases translation efficiency, ensuring effective protein production from dynamic transcripts that are marked by m6A. Therefore, the m6A modification in mRNA endows gene expression with fast responses and controllable protein production through these mechanisms.,},

	abstract = {Protein translation typically begins with the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex to the 5′ cap of mRNAs by a cap-binding complex. However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in their 5′ UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5′ UTR m6A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5′UTR m6A. Additionally, increased m6A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m6A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5′ UTR m6A. These data show that 5′ UTR m6A bypasses 5′ cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.,},

To explore these questions, we developed conditions to examine N6-adenosine methylase activity in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Transfer of the methyl group from S-[3H methyl]-adenosylmethionine to unlabeled random copolymer RNA substrates of varying ribonucleotide composition revealed a substrate specificity consistent with a previously deduced consensus sequence, Pu[G greater than A]AC[A/C/U]. 32-P labeled RNA substrates of defined sequence were used to examine the minimum sequence requirements for methylation. Each RNA was 20 nucleotides long, and contained either the core consensus sequence GGACU, or some variation of this sequence. RNAs containing GGACU, either in single or multiple copies, were good substrates for methylation, whereas RNAs containing single base substitutions within the GGACU sequence gave dramatically reduced methylation. These results demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methylase has a strict sequence specificity, and that there is no requirement for extended sequences or secondary structures for methylation. Recognition of this sequence does not require an RNA component, as micrococcal nuclease pretreatment of nuclear extracts actually increased methylation efficiency.},

We describe how adopting nf-core standards enables faster development, improved interoperability, and collaboration with the {\textgreater}8,000 members of the nf-core community. The recent development of Nextflow Domain-Specific Language 2 (DSL2) allows pipeline components to be shared and combined across projects. The nf-core community has harnessed this with a library of modules and subworkflows that can be integrated into any Nextflow pipeline, enabling research communities to progressively transition to nf-core best practices. We present a case study of nf-core adoption by six European research consortia, grouped under the EuroFAANG umbrella and dedicated to farmed animal genomics. We believe that the process outlined in this report can inspire many large consortia to seek harmonisation of their data analysis procedures.},

However, those disparate components also increase the probability that the computational experiment fails to be reproducible. Even if software is reproducible today, it may become irreproducible tomorrow without the software itself changing at all, because of the constantly changing software environment in which the software is run. To alleviate irreproducibility, workflow engines integrate with container engines. Additionally, communities that sprung up around workflow engines started to host registries for workflows that follow standards. These standards reduce the effort needed to make workflows automatically reproducible. In this paper, we study automatic reproduction of workflows from two registries, focusing on non-crashing executions. The experimental data lets us analyze the upper bound to which workflow engines could achieve reproducibility. We identify lessons learned in achieving reproducibility in practice.},

Estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) overexpression targeted to mammary epithelial cells in genetically engineered mouse models induces largely similar rates of proliferative mammary disease in prereproductive senescent mice. Herein, with natural reproductive senescence, Esr1 overexpression compared with CYP19A1 overexpression resulted in significantly higher rates of preneoplasia and cancer. Before reproductive senescence, Esr1, but not CYP19A1, overexpressing mice are tamoxifen resistant. However, during reproductive senescence, Esr1 mice exhibited responsiveness. Both Esr1 and CYP19A1 are responsive to letrozole before and after reproductive senescence. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses of RNA-sequencing data sets showed that higher disease rates in Esr1 mice were accompanied by significantly higher expression of cell proliferation genes, including members of prognostic platforms for women with early-stage hormone receptor–positive disease. Tamoxifen and letrozole exposure induced down-regulation of these genes and resolved differences between the two models. Both Esr1 and CYP19A1 overexpression induced abnormal developmental patterns of pregnancy-like gene expression. This resolved with progression through reproductive senescence in CYP19A1 mice, but was more persistent in Esr1 mice, resolving only with tamoxifen and letrozole exposure. In summary, genetically engineered mouse models of Esr1 and CYP19A1 overexpression revealed a diversion of disease processes resulting from the two distinct molecular pathophysiological mammary gland–targeted intrusions into estrogen signaling during reproductive senescence.},

While transcriptome risk profiling is available for human breast cancers, it is not yet developed for prognostication for primary or secondary breast cancer development utilizing at-risk breast tissue. Both estrogen receptor α (ER) and aromatase overexpression have been linked to human breast cancer. Herein, conditional genetically engineered mouse models of estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) were used to show that induction of Esr1 overexpression just before or with reproductive senescence and maintained through age 30 months resulted in significantly higher prevalence of estrogen receptor–positive adenocarcinomas than CYP19A1 overexpression. All adenocarcinomas tested showed high percentages of ER+ cells. Mammary cancer development was preceded by a persistent proliferative transcriptome risk signature initiated within 1 week of transgene induction that showed parallels to the Prosigna/Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50 human prognostic signature for early-stage human ER+ breast cancer. CYP19A1 mice also developed ER+ mammary cancers, but histology was more divided between adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous, with one ER– adenocarcinoma. Results demonstrate that, like humans, generation of ER+ adenocarcinoma in mice was facilitated by aging mice past the age of reproductive senescence.

	abstract = {The objective of this review is to describe existing data on breast cancer incidence and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), in particular in sub-Saharan Africa; identify the limitations of these data; and review what is known about breast cancer control strategies in sub-Saharan African countries and other LMICs. Available estimates demonstrate that breast cancer incidence and mortality are rising in LMICs, including in Africa, although high-quality data from LMICs (and particularly from sub-Saharan Africa) are largely lacking. Case fatality rates from breast cancer appear to be substantially higher in LMICs than in high-income countries. Significant challenges exist to developing breast cancer control programs in LMICs, perhaps particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the most effective strategies for treatment and early detection in the context of limited resources are uncertain. High-quality research on breast cancer incidence and mortality and implementation research to guide effective breast cancer control strategies in LMICs are urgently needed. Enhanced investment in breast cancer research and treatment in LMICs should be a global public health priority.},

We also included 1151 noninflammatory, locally advanced, invasive breast cancers with chest wall/breast skin involvement (LABC), 7600 noninflammatory invasive case subjects without chest wall/breast skin involvement (BC), and 93 654 control subjects matched to case subjects on age and year at diagnosis and mammography registry.

High body mass index (BMI) increased IBC risk irrespective of menopausal status and estrogen receptor (ER) expression; rate ratios for BMI 30 and greater vs BMI less than 25 were 3.90 (95\% CI = 1.50 to 10.14) in premenopausal women and 3.70 (95\% CI = 1.98 to 6.94) in peri/postmenopausal women not currently using hormones.

	abstract = {Objectives: This study is a systematic review of literature published up to May of 2010 aimed to identify relationships between dietary fat, and fat subtypes, with risk of breast cancer in women. Methods: Descriptive data, estimates of relative risk and associated 95\% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from relative studies and analyzed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Cohort study results indicated significant summary relative risks between polyunsaturated fat and breast cancer (1.091, 95\% CI: 1.001; 1.184). In case-control studies no association between fat and breast cancer was observed. Post-menopausal women indicated a significant association between total fat (1.042, 95\%CI: 1.013; 1.073), PUFA intake (1.22, 95\% CI: 1.08; 1.381), and breast cancer. A non-significant inverse relation between intake of all fat types and breast cancer was identified in premenopausal women. Conclusions: These results support the idea that possible elevations in serum estrogen levels by an adult exposure to a high-fat diet would increase breast cancer risk. Furthermore, menopausal status was observed to affect women's risk of breast cancer. Higher risks of breast cancer were found in post-menopausal women consuming diets high in total fat and polyunsaturated fats. Conversely, dietary fat appears to have preventative effects in pre-menopausal women. This study takes a transformative approach combining epidemiological, biomedical, and evolutionary theory to evaluate how biocultural variations in risk factors (i.e., diet and reproduction) affect the evolution of breast cancers.

The etiology of breast cancer is attributed to a complex interaction between various modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This etiology is determined by genetics, environmental, nutritional, hormonal, and heritable elements that contribute to the development of this disease. Risk factors include prior history of breast cancer, positive family history, obesity, tall stature, smoking, alcohol consumption, early menarche, late menopause, sedentary lifestyle, nulliparity and hormone replacement therapy. Factors associated with decreased risk of breast cancer include multiparity, history of breastfeeding, physical activity, weight loss, and prophylactic surgical and medical interventions. \&nbsp;In the United States, approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. This disease is more common in white, post-menopausal females. Risk increases with older age with about 80\% of breast cancer patients being older than 50 years. Analyzing the etiology of breast cancer allows for the development of improved screening and treatment interventions. In this chapter, the etiology of breast cancer along with the risk factors associated with this disease are discussed.},

The authors evaluated associations of hormone-related factors with breast cancer subtypes in a population-based case-control study involving 1,409 ER-positive (ER+)/PR-positive (PR+) cases, 712 ER-negative (ER−)/PR-negative (PR−) cases, 301 ER+/PR− cases, 254 ER−/PR+ cases, and 3,474 controls aged 20–70 years in Shanghai, China (phase I, 1996–1998; phase II, 2002–2005). Polytomous logistic regression and Wald tests for heterogeneity across subtypes were conducted. Breast cancer risks associated with age at menarche, age at menopause, breastfeeding, age at first livebirth, waist-to-hip ratio, and oral contraceptive use did not differ by hormone receptor status. Among postmenopausal women, higher parity (≥2 children vs. 1) was associated with reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.91) and higher body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) with increased risk (highest quartile: OR = 2.40, 95\% CI: 1.65, 3.47) of the ER+/PR+ subtype but was unrelated to the ER−/PR− subtype (for parity, Pheterogeneity = 0.02; for BMI, Pheterogeneity \&lt; 0.01). Hormone replacement therapy (OR = 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.40, 3.62) and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.59, 95\% CI: 1.01, 2.51) appeared to be preferentially associated with the ER+/PR− subtype. These findings indicate that BMI, parity, hormone replacement therapy, and alcohol consumption may play different roles in subtypes of breast cancer. More research is needed to better understand the etiology of 2 relatively rare subtypes, ER+/PR− tumors and ER−/PR+ tumors.},

	abstract = {Hyperprolactinemia, defined as a sustained elevation of prolactin (PRL) levels greater than 530 mIU/L in women and greater than 424 mIU/L in men, has been implicated for a long time in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Elevated PRL values (approximately 2-3 times higher than the reference values) are a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with first-generation drugs, and most antipsychotics carry a standard warning regarding PRL elevations on their US product labels. These associations foster undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses in both otherwise healthy patients and cancer patients. This review assesses both the preclinical and clinical evidence that has led to the hypothesis of PRL's role in breast cancer risk or breast cancer progression. It is concluded that taken together, the published data are unconvincing and insufficient to deprive cancer patients in general and breast cancer patients specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic or antidepressant medications for serious psychiatric indications. We thus call on revised medication guidelines to avoid the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses among cancer patients based on an unproven contraindication to psychiatric medications.

	abstract = {Breast cancer mortality rates in South Carolina (SC) are 40 \% higher among African-American (AA) than European-American (EA) women. Proposed reasons include race-associated variations in care and/or tumor characteristics, which may be subject to income effects. We evaluated race-associated differences in tumor biologic phenotype and stage among low-income participants in a government-funded screening program. Best Chance Network (BCN) data were linked with the SC Central Cancer Registry. Characteristics of breast cancers diagnosed in BCN participants aged 47–64 years during 1996–2006 were abstracted. Race-specific case proportions and incidence rates based on estrogen receptor (ER) status and histologic grade were estimated. Among 33,880 low-income women accessing BCN services, repeat breast cancer screening utilization was poor, especially among EAs. Proportionally, stage at diagnosis did not differ by race (607 cancers, 53 \% among AAs), with about 40 \% advanced stage. Compared to EAs, invasive tumors in AAs were 67 \% more likely (proportions) to be of poor-prognosis phenotype (both ER-negative and high-grade); this was more a result of the 46 \% lesser AA incidence (rates) of better-prognosis (ER+ lower-grade) cancer than the 32 \% greater incidence of poor-prognosis disease (p values {\textless}0.01). When compared to the general SC population, racial disparities in poor-prognostic features within the BCN population were attenuated; this was due to more frequent adverse tumor features in EAs rather than improvements for AAs. Among low-income women in SC, closing the breast cancer racial and income mortality gaps will require improved early diagnosis, addressing causes of racial differences in tumor biology, and improved care for cancers of poor-prognosis biology.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the major public health issues and is considered a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Its early diagnosis can effectively help in increasing the chances of survival rate. To this end, biopsy is usually followed as a gold standard approach in which tissues are collected for microscopic analysis. However, the histopathological analysis of breast cancer is non-trivial, labor-intensive, and may lead to a high degree of disagreement among pathologists. Therefore, an automatic diagnostic system could assist pathologists to improve the effectiveness of diagnostic processes. This paper presents an ensemble deep learning approach for the definite classification of non-carcinoma and carcinoma breast cancer histopathology images using our collected dataset. We trained four different models based on pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19 architectures. Initially, we followed 5-fold cross-validation operations on all the individual models, namely, fully-trained VGG16, fine-tuned VGG16, fully-trained VGG19, and fine-tuned VGG19 models. Then, we followed an ensemble strategy by taking the average of predicted probabilities and found that the ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and fine-tuned VGG19 performed competitive classification performance, especially on the carcinoma class. The ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and VGG19 models offered sensitivity of 97.73\% for carcinoma class and overall accuracy of 95.29\%. Also, it offered an F1 score of 95.29\%. These experimental results demonstrated that our proposed deep learning approach is effective for the automatic classification of complex-natured histopathology images of breast cancer, more specifically for carcinoma images.},

	abstract = {Advanced stage at diagnosis contributes to low breast cancer survival rates in sub-Saharan Africa. Living far from health services is known to delay presentation, but the effect of residential distance to hospital, the radius at which this effect sets in and the women most affected have not been quantified. In a periurban South African setting, we examined the effect of a geographic information system (GIS)-measured straight-line distance, from a patient's residence to diagnostic hospital, on stage at diagnosis in 1,071 public-sector breast cancer patients diagnosed during 2006–2012. Generalized linear models were used to estimate risk ratios for late stage (stage III/IV vs. stage I/II) associated with distance, adjusting for year of diagnosis, age, race and socioeconomic indicators. Mean age of patients was 55 years, 90\% were black African and diagnoses were at stages I (5\%), II (41\%), III (46\%) and IV (8\%). Sixty-two percent of patients with distances {\textgreater}20 km (n = 338) had a late stage at diagnosis compared to 50\% with distances {\textless}20 km (n = 713, p = 0.02). Risk of late stage at diagnosis was 1.25-fold higher (95\% CI: 1.09, 1.42) per 30 km. Effects were pronounced in an underrepresented group of patients over age 70. This positive stage–distance association held to 40 km, and plateaued or slightly reversed in patients (9\%) living beyond this distance. Studies of woman and the societal and healthcare-level influences on these delays and on the late stage at diagnosis distribution are needed to inform interventions to improve diagnostic stage and breast cancer survival in this and similar settings.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare the survival rates of women with BRCA associated breast cancer who did and did not undergo mastectomy of the contralateral breast.
Design Retrospective analysis.
Setting 12 cancer genetics clinics.
Participants 390 women with a family history of stage I or II breast cancer who were carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and initially treated with unilateral or bilateral mastectomy. 181 patients had mastectomy of the contralateral breast. Patients were followed for up to 20 years from diagnosis.
Main outcome measure Death from breast cancer.
Results 79 women died of breast cancer in the follow-up period (18 in the bilateral mastectomy group and 61 in the unilateral mastectomy group). The median follow-up time was 14.3 years (range 0.1-20.0 years). At 20 years the survival rate for women who had mastectomy of the contralateral breast was 88\% (95\% confidence interval 83\% to 93\%) and for those who did not was 66\% (59\% to 73\%). In a multivariable analysis, controlling for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, treatment, and other prognostic features, contralateral mastectomy was associated with a 48\% reduction in death from breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.52, 95\% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.93; P=0.03). In a propensity score adjusted analysis of 79 matched pairs, the association was not significant (0.60, 0.34 to 1.06; P=0.08). Based on these results, we predict that of 100 women treated with contralateral mastectomy, 87 will be alive at 20 years compared with 66 of 100 women treated with unilateral mastectomy.
Conclusions This study suggests that women who are positive for BRCA mutations and who are treated for stage I or II breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy are less likely to die from breast cancer than women who are treated with unilateral mastectomy. Given the small number of events in this cohort, further research is required to confirm these findings.},

Estrogen signaling pathways have been identified as efficient targets of breast cancer therapy, given their key role in promoting breast tumor growth. Agents blocking estrogen-mediated pathways are routinely used in clinical applications in patients displaying estrogen-sensitive breast cancer subtypes; however intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment often occurs or develops, thus limiting their efficacy. This limitation has highlighted an imperative need to identify new predictive biomarkers. Recent findings have highlighted a role for the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in breast cancer tumorigenesis. LKB1 is a serine/threonine kinase mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), implicated in many cellular processes including energy metabolism, cell polarization and cell cycle arrest and has also been shown to play an essential role as a tumor suppressor gene by negatively regulating the mTOR pathway. This review provides an overview of previous findings and ongoing research on LKB1, and substantiates the use of this kinase as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarker of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Both estrogen, through the estrogen receptor (ER), and growth factors, through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, have been shown to independently promote cell survival. Here, we investigated the role of ER/PI3K-AKT crosstalk in the regulation of cell survival in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The ER inhibitor ICI 182,780 was used to determine the requirement of the ER for estrogen in the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) induced apoptosis. Gene reporter assays and Western blot analyses were used to determine the involvement of the pro-survival factor Bcl-2 and the coactivator GRIP1 in this survival crosstalk. We demonstrated that an intact ER signaling pathway was required for estrogen to suppress apoptosis induced by TNFα. Our gene reporter assays revealed that ERα, not ERβ, was targeted by AKT, resulting in transcriptional potentiation of the full-length Bcl-2 promoter, ultimately leading to increased Bcl-2 protein levels. AKT targeted both activation function (AF) domains of the ERα for maximal induction of Bcl-2 reporter activity, although the AF-II domain was predominately targeted. In addition, AKT also caused an upregulation of GRIP1 protein levels. Finally, AKT and GRIP1 cooperated to increase Bcl-2 protein expression to a greater level than either factor alone. Collectively, our study suggests a role for ER/PI3K-AKT crosstalk in cell survival and documents the ability of AKT to regulate Bcl-2 expression via differential activation of ERα and ERβ as well as regulation of GRIP1.},

	abstract = {The breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) play important roles in breast cancer occurrence, recurrence and metastasis. However, the role of estrogen signaling, a signaling pathway important in development and progression of breast cancer, in regulation of BCSC has not been well established. Previously, we identified and cloned a variant of estrogen receptor α, ER-α36, with a molecular weight of 36 kDa. ER-α36 lacks both transactivation domains AF-1 and AF-2 of the 66 kDa full-length ER-α (ER-α66) and mediates rapid estrogen signaling to promote proliferation of breast cancer cells. In this study, we aim to investigate the function and the underlying mechanism of ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling in growth regulation of the ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. ER-positive breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D as well as the variants with different levels of ER-α36 expression were used. The effects of estrogen on BCSC's abilities of growth, self-renewal, differentiation and tumor-seeding were examined using tumorsphere formation, flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorence staining and in vivo xenograft assays. The underlying mechanisms were also studied with Western-blot analysis. We found that 17-β-estradiol (E2β) treatment increased the population of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells while failed to do so in the cells with knocked-down levels of ER-α36 expression. Cells with forced expression of recombinant ER-α36, however, responded strongly to E2β treatment by increasing growth in vitro and tumor-seeding efficiency in vivo. The rapid estrogen signaling via the AKT/GSK3β pathway is involved in estrogen-stimulated growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We concluded that ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling plays an important role in regulation and maintenance of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.},

However, there is evidence indicating that ovariectomy prevents the development of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer, suggesting that estrogen signaling is involved in the development of ER-negative breast cancer. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36 mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling and is highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in 10/12 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. We investigated the role of mitogenic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of ER-α36 and found that these cells strongly responded to mitogenic estrogen signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the small hairpin RNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen. ER-α36 physically interacted with the EGFR/Src/Shc complex and mediated estrogen-induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src. EGFR signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter, and ER-α36 expression was able to stabilize EGFR protein. Our results, thus demonstrated that ER-α36 mediates nongenomic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway in ER-negative breast cancer cells and suggested that a subset of ER-negative breast tumors that expresses ER-α36, retains responsiveness to mitogenic estrogen signaling.},

Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) has been implicated in mediating carcinogenesis in prostate and lung cancers. In addition, CAND1 is an established prognostic biomarker for worse prognosis in liver cancer. However, the prognostic significance of CAND1 in breast cancer has not yet been explored. In this study, Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (Bc-GenExMiner) and TIMER2.0 were utilized to explore the mRNA expression of CAND1 in ERα-positive breast cancer patients. The Kaplan–Meier plotter was used to explore the relationship between CAND1 expression and several prognostic indicators. The Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) web server was then used to explore the pathways of the genes that correlate with CAND1 in ERα-positive breast cancer. Immune infiltration was investigated using Bc-GenExMiner. Our bioinformatics analysis illustrates that breast cancer patients have higher CAND1 compared to normal breast tissue and that ERα-positive breast cancer patients with a high expression of CAND1 have poor overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) outcomes. Higher CAND1 expression was observed in histologic grade 3 compared to grades 2 and 1. Our results revealed that CAND1 positively correlates with lymph nodes and negatively correlates with the infiltration of immune cells, which is in agreement with published reports. Our findings suggest that CAND1 might mediate invasion and metastasis in ERα-positive breast cancer, possibly through the activation of estrogen and androgen signaling pathways; however, experiments should be carried out to further explore the role of CAND1 in activating the androgen and estrogen signaling pathways. In conclusion, the results suggest that CAND1 could be used as a potential novel biomarker for worse prognosis in ERα-positive breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Many tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells, only some of which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies. Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells, often termed “cancer stem cells” or “cancer stem-like cells” (CSCs), rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells. Here we report that, in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology, estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx3 signaling pathway. Estrogen or FGF9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells, whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs. Furthermore, reduction of FGFR or Tbx3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation, whereas ectopic Tbx3 expression increased tumor seeding potential by 100-fold. These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology.},

	abstract = {Objectives

Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC) is a rare neoplasm accounting for \&lt;1\% of all breast cancer. We evaluated the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes of MBC.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with pathologically proven MBC were reviewed from the institutional breast cancer database from 2000 to 2017.

Results

A total of 136 patients diagnosed with MBC were included in the study. The median age of the diagnosis was 60 years, and 60\% of patients were stage II at diagnosis, and 22\% were stage III. About two-thirds of the patients were triple-negative; 93\% had nuclear grade III, and 25\% had a lymphovascular invasion. Squamous differentiation (29\%) was the most common histologic subtype, followed by the spindle subtype (21\%). The most common distant metastases were lung (22\%), followed by bone (13\%). Moreover, 60\% had a mastectomy, 19\% had endocrine therapy, 58\% had radiation, 51\% received anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 26\% had non-anthracycline chemotherapy, and 22\% received no chemotherapy. In the entire cohort, the two-year overall survival (OS) and five-year OS were 79\% and 69\%, respectively, and the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) and five-year PFS were 72\% and 61\%, respectively. On multivariable analysis, the stage of MBC (stage III: hazard ratio (HR), 5.065 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-25.27) (p=0.048)), poor functional status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, 2; HR, 24.736 (95\% CI, 1.92-318.73) (p=0.014)), and distant metastasis to the brain (HR, 8.453 (95\% CI, 1.88-38.04) (p=0.005)) and lung (HR, 42.102 (95\% CI, 7.20-246.36) (p\&lt;0.001)) were significant predictors of decreased OS.

Conclusions

MBC demonstrated early disease progression and poor overall survival. The stage of MBC, decreased performance status, and metastasis to the lung and brain were independent poor prognostic factors.},

Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data on 135 157 invasive breast cancer cases diagnosed from 1992 to 2001, relationships between nine histologic types of breast cancer and various tumour characteristics were assessed. Among women aged 50–89 years at diagnosis, lobular and ductal/lobular carcinoma cases were more likely to be diagnosed with stage III/IV, ⩾5.0 cm, and node-positive tumours compared to ductal carcinoma cases. Mucinous, comedo, tubular, and medullary carcinomas were less likely to present at an advanced stage. Lobular, ductal/lobular, mucinous, tubular, and papillary carcinomas were less likely, and comedo, medullary, and inflammatory carcinomas were more likely to be oestrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative and high grade (notably, 68.2\% of medullary carcinomas were ER−/PR− vs 19.3\% of ductal carcinomas). In general, similar differences were observed among women diagnosed at age 30–49 years. Inflammatory carcinomas are associated with more aggressive tumour phenotypes, and mucinous, tubular, and papillary tumours are associated with less aggressive phenotypes. The histologic types of breast cancer studied here differ greatly in their clinical presentations, and the differences in their hormone receptor profiles and grades point to their likely different aetiologies.},

Methods We collected the clinical data of breast cancer patients in Xinxiang Central Hospital from 2016 to 2021, those data was classified by gender and pathological types of breast cancer patients; and we also measured and analyzed the expression of breast cancer related biomarkers (ER, PR, HER2 and Ki-67) by immunohistochemistry, and based on expression of these biomarkers, the molecular typing of breast cancer were also classified.
Results 3210 cases breast cancer patients were collected in this study; there were 3205 female patients and 5 male patients, accounting for 99.84\% and 0.16\% in total breast cancer patients, respectively. Classification according to pathological conditions of breast cancer patients, there were 2761 cases patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, accounting for 86.01\% in total breast cancer patients, and then mucinous adenocarcinoma (109/3210, 3.40\%), lobular carcinoma (106/3210, 3.30\%), ductal carcinoma in situ (75/3210, 2.34\%), papillary carcinoma (61/3210, 1.90\%), intraductal carcinoma (40/3210, 1.25\%), myeloid carcinoma (27/3210, 0.84\%); There were also including some rare breast cancer types including cribriform carcinoma (6/3210, 0.19\%), lymph node metastasis (7/3210, 0.22\%), occult breast carcinoma (5/3210, 0.14\%), invasive carcinoma (5/3210, 0.14\%), squamous cell carcinoma (3/3210, 0.09\%), fibroadenoma (3/3210, 0.09\%), pleomorphic carcinoma (2/3210, 0.06\%). Classification according to molecular typing of breast cancer, the number of breast cancer patients with Luminal A type [ER(+)/PR(+) HER2(-)Ki67{\textless}14\%] were 207 cases, accounting for 6.45\% in total breast cancer patients, the number of breast cancer patients with Luminal B type I [ER(+)/PR(+) HER2(-)] were 243 cases, accounting for 7.57\% in total breast cancer patients, the number of breast cancer patients with Luminal B type II [(ER(+)/PR(+)HER2(+) any Ki67] was 254 cases, accounting for 7.91\% in total breast cancer patients, and the number of Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) were 390 cases, accounting for 12.15\% in total breast cancer patients.The average expression rate of Ki-67 in ER (+) and/or PR (+) breast cancer patients was 20.39+27.33\%, while the average expression rate of Ki-67 in ER(-)/PR(-) breast cancer patients was 36.35\%+30.14\%, and the difference between two patients was significant (p=0.0021); the average expression rate of Ki-67 in HER2 positive breast cancer patients was 23.01\%+21.96\%, the average expression rate of Ki-67 in HER2 negative breast cancer patients was 29.44\%+24.16\%, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.2589).The main treatment methods of breast cancer patients in Northern Henan Province were antitumor drugs and chemotherapy, the results showed that 87.29\% patients were treated by chemotherapy; and high frequency anti-tumor drugs used for breast cancer treatment were Epirubicin (1527/3210, 47.57\%), Cyclophosphamide (1172/3210, 36.51\%),Paclitaxel (1141/3210,35.55\%), Tamoxifen (912/3210, 28.41\%).
Conclusions The main pathological type of breast cancer are invasive ductal carcinoma, and the main treatment methods of breast cancer patients in Northern Henan Province were antitumor drugs and chemotherapy. In the four kinds of molecular typing of breast cancer, the incidence rate of TNBC is highest compared with Luminal B type II[(ER(+)/PR(+)HER2(+) any Ki67], Luminal B type I [ER(+)/PR(+)HER2(-)] and Luminal A type [ER(+)/PR(+) HER2(-) Ki67{\textless}14\%]; these results may provide some suggestions for the local oncologist.},

	abstract = {Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer is the most prevalent subtype of invasive breast cancers. Patients with ER-positive breast cancers have variable clinical outcomes and responses to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. With the advent of microarray-based gene expression profiling, unsupervised analysis methods have resulted in a classification of ER-positive disease into subtypes with different outcomes (ie, luminal A and luminal B); subsequent studies have demonstrated that these subtypes have different patterns of genetic aberrations and outcome. Studies based on supervised methods of microarray analysis have led to the development of prognostic gene signatures that identify a subgroup of ER-positive breast cancer patients with excellent outcome, who could forego chemotherapy. Despite the excitement with these approaches, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the subclassification of ER-positive cancers and the prognostic value of gene signatures is largely driven by the expression levels of proliferation-related genes and that proliferation markers, such as Ki67, may provide equivalent prognostic information to that provided by gene signatures. In this review, we discuss the contribution of gene expression profiling to the classification of ER-positive breast cancer, the role of prognostic and predictive signatures, and the potential stratification of ER-positive disease according to their dependency on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway.},

	abstract = {PurposeTrastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd, formerly DS-8201a) is a novel human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted antibody drug conjugate (ADC) with a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. A dose escalation and expansion phase I study evaluated the safety and activity of T-DXd in patients with advanced HER2-expressing/mutated solid tumors. Here, results for T-DXd at the recommended doses for expansion (RDE) in patients with HER2-low (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 1+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization−) breast cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02564900) are reported.Patients and MethodsEligible patients had advanced/metastatic HER2-low–expressing breast cancer refractory to standard therapies. The RDE of 5.4 or 6.4 mg/kg T-DXd were administered intravenously once every 3 weeks until withdrawal of consent, unacceptable toxicity, or progressive disease. Antitumor activity and safety were assessed.ResultsBetween August 2016 and August 2018, 54 patients were enrolled and received ≥ 1 dose of T-DXd at the RDE. Patients were extensively pretreated (median, 7.5 prior therapies). The confirmed objective response rate by independent central review was 20/54 (37.0\%; 95\% CI, 24.3\% to 51.3\%) with median duration of response of 10.4 months (95\% CI, 8.8 month to not evaluable). Most patients (53/54; 98.1\%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE; grade ≥ 3; 34/54; 63.0\%). Common (≥ 5\%) grade ≥ 3 TEAEs included decreases in neutrophil, platelet, and WBC counts; anemia; hypokalemia; AST increase; decreased appetite; and diarrhea. Three patients treated at 6.4 mg/kg suffered fatal events associated with T-DXd–induced interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis as determined by an independent adjudication committee.ConclusionThe novel HER2-targeted ADC, T-DXd, demonstrated promising preliminary antitumor activity in patients with HER2-low breast cancer. Most toxicities were GI or hematologic in nature. ILD is an important identified risk and should be monitored closely and proactively managed.},

Canonical splicing is also linked with circRNA biogenesis either from the parental transcript or internal to the circRNA, and is not fully utilized in circRNA software. Here we present Ularcirc, a software tool that integrates the visualization of both BSJ and forward splicing junctions and provides downstream analysis of selected circRNA candidates. Ularcirc utilizes the output of CIRI, circExplorer, or raw chimeric output of the STAR aligner and assembles BSJ count table to allow multi-sample analysis. We used Ularcirc to identify and characterize circRNA from public and in-house generated data sets and demonstrate how it can be used to (i) discover novel splicing patterns of parental transcripts, (ii) detect internal splicing patterns of circRNA, and (iii) reveal the complexity of BSJ formation. Furthermore, we identify circRNA that have potential open reading frames longer than their linear sequence. Finally, we detected and validated the presence of a novel class of circRNA generated from ApoA4 transcripts whose BSJ derive from multiple non-canonical splicing sites within coding exons.

	abstract = {Pervasive expression of circular RNA is a recently discovered feature of eukaryotic gene expression programs, yet its function remains largely unknown. The presumed biogenesis of these RNAs involves a non-canonical ‘backsplicing’ event. Recent studies in mammalian cell culture posit that backsplicing is facilitated by inverted repeats flanking the circularized exon(s). Although such sequence elements are common in mammals, they are rare in lower eukaryotes, making current models insufficient to describe circularization. Through systematic splice site mutagenesis and the identification of splicing intermediates, we show that circular RNA in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is generated through an exon-containing lariat precursor. Furthermore, we have performed high-throughput and comprehensive mutagenesis of a circle-forming exon, which enabled us to discover a systematic effect of exon length on RNA circularization. Our results uncover a mechanism for circular RNA biogenesis that may account for circularization in genes that lack noticeable flanking intronic secondary structure., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07540.001, DNA contains the instructions to make proteins. These instructions are first copied into a molecule of RNA, which often has sections that code for protein (called exons) interrupted by non-coding sections (called introns). A process called splicing removes the introns and joins the exons to form a mature RNA molecule that is then translated to make proteins., The standard splicing process joins the first exon to the second, and the second to the third, and so on to produce a liner RNA molecule. Occasionally, one or more of the exons can be skipped in a process known as ‘alternative splicing’. In recent years, scientists have discovered that another type of alternative splicing, which creates circular RNA molecules, is common in animal cells. It was suggested that circular RNAs might form when the splicing machinery joins the two ends of the same exon via a process referred to as ‘backsplicing’., Standard splicing first converts an intron into a looped structure called a ‘lariat’ (which resembles a lasso); the lariat is then removed by the splicing machinery and destroyed. When exons are skipped during alternative splicing, a large lariat containing the skipped exon is produced. Now, Barrett et al. have used yeast cells to investigate how circular RNAs are formed. Yeast is a good model to study this process because it can be manipulated easily in the laboratory and expresses circular RNAs. The experiments show that lariat structures containing exons (as would be expected from exon-skipping) are a common intermediate step before the production of a circular RNA. However, some exon-containing lariats do not go on to form circular RNAs, suggesting that additional factors are important for the production of circular RNAs., Barrett et al. next investigated the reasons why certain exons formed circular RNAs while others did not and revealed that longer exons formed circular RNAs more readily than shorter exons. Further work is now required to understand the molecular basis of this result and identify other factors that contribute to the formation of circular RNAs., DOI:

Although millions of circRNA candidates have been identified, it remains a major challenge for determining circRNA reliability because of various types of false positives. Here, we systematically assess the impacts of numerous factors related to circRNA identification, conservation, biogenesis, and function on circRNA reliability by comparisons of circRNA expression from mock and the corresponding colinear/polyadenylated RNA–depleted datasets based on three different RNA treatment approaches. Eight important indicators of circRNA reliability are determined. The relative contribution to variability explained analyses reveal that the relative importance of these factors in affecting circRNA reliability in descending order is the conservation level of circRNA, full-length circular sequences, supporting BSJ read count, both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites at the same colinear transcript isoforms, both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites at the annotated exon boundaries, BSJs detected by multiple tools, supporting functional features, and both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites undergoing alternative splicing. This study thus provides a useful guideline and an important resource for selecting high-confidence circRNAs for further investigations.},

	abstract = {Circular RNA (circRNA) is mainly generated by the splice donor of a downstream exon joining to an upstream splice acceptor, a phenomenon known as backsplicing. It has been reported that circRNA can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, transcriptional regulators, or potential biomarkers. The availability of massive non-polyadenylated transcriptomes data has facilitated the genome-wide identification of thousands of circRNAs. Several circRNA detection tools or pipelines have recently been developed, and it is essential to provide useful guidelines on these pipelines for users, including a comprehensive and unbiased comparison. Here, we provide an improved and easy-to-use circRNA read simulator that can produce mimicking backsplicing reads supporting circRNAs deposited in CircBase. Moreover, we compared the performance of 11 circRNA detection tools on both simulated and real datasets. We assessed their performance regarding metrics such as precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and Area under Curve. It is concluded that no single method dominated on all of these metrics. Among all of the state-of-the-art tools, CIRI, CIRCexplorer, and KNIFE, which achieved better balanced performance between their precision and sensitivity, compared favorably to the other methods.},

There is a strong genetic component to many disease subtypes (e.g., cardiomyopathy) and we are just beginning to understand the relevant genetic factors. Several studies have related RNA splicing to cardiovascular disease and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an emerging player. circRNAs, which originate through back-splicing events from primary transcripts, are resistant to exonucleases and typically not polyadenylated. Initial functional studies show clear phenotypic outcomes for selected circRNAs. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive catalogue of RNase R-resistant circRNA species for the adult murine heart. This work combines state-of-the-art circle sequencing with our novel DCC software to explore the circRNA landscape of heart tissue. Overall, we identified 575 circRNA species that pass a beta-binomial test for enrichment (false discovery rate of 1\%) in the exonuclease-treated sequencing sample. Several circRNAs can be directly attributed to host genes that have been previously described as associated with cardiovascular disease. Further studies of these candidate circRNAs may reveal disease-relevant properties or functions of specific circRNAs.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder in young adults. Despite extensive studies, only a fraction of MS heritability has been explained, with association studies focusing primarily on protein-coding genes, essentially for the difficulty of interpreting non-coding features. However, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and functional elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), are crucial regulators of many pathways and cellular mechanisms, and they have been implicated in a growing number of diseases. In this work, we searched for possible enrichments in non-coding elements at MS genome-wide associated loci, with the aim to highlight their possible involvement in the susceptibility to the disease. We first reconstructed the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the Italian population using data of 727,478 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,668 healthy individuals. The genomic coordinates of the obtained LD blocks were intersected with those of the top hits identified in previously published MS genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By a bootstrapping approach, we hence demonstrated a striking enrichment of non-coding elements, especially of circular RNAs (circRNAs) mapping in the 73 LD blocks harboring MS-associated SNPs. In particular, we found a total of 482 circRNAs (annotated in publicly available databases) vs. a mean of 194 ± 65 in the random sets of LD blocks, using 1,000 iterations. As a proof of concept of a possible functional relevance of this observation, we experimentally verified that the expression levels of a circRNA derived from an MS-associated locus, i.e., hsa\_circ\_0043813 from the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}STAT3{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} gene, can be modulated by the three genotypes at the disease-associated SNP. Finally, by evaluating RNA-seq data of two cell lines, SH-SY5Y and Jurkat cells, representing tissues relevant for MS, we identified 18 (two novel) circRNAs derived from MS-associated genes. In conclusion, this work showed for the first time that MS-GWAS top hits map in LD blocks enriched in circRNAs, suggesting circRNAs as possible novel contributors to the disease pathogenesis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This process is tightly regulated and depends on transcription factors, micro-RNAs, and long non-coding RNAs. Recently, also circular RNA (circRNA) were found to regulate cellular processes. Their expression pattern and their identity is however less well defined. Here, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression in human hematopoietic progenitors, and in differentiated lymphoid and myeloid cells. We here show that the expression of circRNA is cell-type specific, and increases upon maturation. CircRNA splicing variants can also be cell-type specific. Furthermore, nucleated hematopoietic cells contain circRNA that have higher expression levels than the corresponding linear RNA. Enucleated blood cells, i.e. platelets and erythrocytes, were suggested to use RNA to maintain their function, respond to environmental factors or to transmit signals to other cells via microvesicles. Here we show that platelets and erythrocytes contain the highest number of circRNA of all hematopoietic cells, and that the type and numbers of circRNA changes during maturation. This cell-type specific expression pattern of circRNA in hematopoietic cells suggests a hithero unappreciated role in differentiation and cellular function.},

Annotation of circRNAs depends on sequencing reads spanning the backsplice junction and therefore map as non-linear reads in the genome. Several pipelines have been developed to specifically identify these non-linear reads and consequently predict the landscape of circRNAs based on deep sequencing datasets. Here, we use common RNAseq datasets to scrutinize and compare the output from five different algorithms; circRNA\_finder, find\_circ, CIRCexplorer, CIRI, and MapSplice and evaluate the levels of bona fide and false positive circRNAs based on RNase R resistance. By this approach, we observe surprisingly dramatic differences between the algorithms specifically regarding the highly expressed circRNAs and the circRNAs derived from proximal splice sites. Collectively, this study emphasizes that circRNA annotation should be handled with care and that several algorithms should ideally be combined to achieve reliable predictions.},

CircRNA in NK/T-LAHS and healthy control patient serum were assessed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). One hundred and forty-three differentially expressed circRNAs of which 114 were up-regulated and 29 were down-regulated in NK/T-LAHS patients were identified. Next, Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses to explore the roles of these circRNAs were utilized, and a microRNA (miRNA) target gene prediction software to predict the interaction of circRNAs and miRNAs was used. Moreover, five circRNAs were then selected as NK/T-LAHS candidate circRNAs which were related to tumors and contained NK/T-LAHS-related miRNA-binding sites. Using real-time PCR, the significant up-regulation of these five circRNAs in NK/T-LAHS patient serum were verified. Together these results show that circRNAs may serve as valuable diagnostic biomarkers of early NK/T-LAHS, with potential therapeutic targets in disease progression.},

However, detection of NCL transcripts involves two major challenges: removal of false positives arising from alignment artifacts and discrimination between different types of NCL transcripts (trans-spliced, circular or fusion transcripts). Here, we developed a new NCL-transcript-detecting method (‘NCLscan’), which utilized a stepwise alignment strategy to almost completely eliminate false calls (\&gt;98\% precision) without sacrificing true positives, enabling NCLscan outperform 18 other publicly-available tools (including fusion- and circular-RNA-detecting tools) in terms of sensitivity and precision, regardless of the generation strategy of simulated dataset, type of intragenic or intergenic NCL event, read depth of coverage, read length or expression level of NCL transcript. With the high accuracy, NCLscan was applied to distinguishing between trans-spliced, circular and fusion transcripts on the basis of poly(A)- and nonpoly(A)-selected RNA-seq data. We showed that circular RNAs were expressed more ubiquitously, more abundantly and less cell type-specifically than trans-spliced and fusion transcripts. Our study thus describes a robust pipeline for the discovery of NCL transcripts, and sheds light on the fundamental biology of these non-canonical RNA events in human transcriptome.},

Recent studies have revealed that circRNAs play a crucial role in fine-tuning the level of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of gene expression by sequestering miRNAs. The interaction of circRNAs with disease-associated miRNAs suggests that circRNAs are important in the pathology of disease. However, the effects and roles of circRNAs in macrophage polarization have yet to be explored. In the present study, we performed a circRNA microarray to compare the circRNA expression profiles of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) under two distinct polarizing conditions (M1 macrophages induced by interferon-γ and LPS stimulation, and M2 macrophages induced by interleukin-4 stimulation). Our results showed that a total of 189 circRNAs were differentially expressed between M1 and M2 macrophages. Differentially expressed circRNAs with a high fold-change were selected for validation by RT-qPCR: circRNA-003780, circRNA-010056, and circRNA-010231 were upregulated and circRNA-003424, circRNA-013630, circRNA-001489 and circRNA-018127 were downregulated (fold-change {\textgreater}4, P{\textless}0.05) in M1 compared to M2, which was found to correlate with the microarray data. Furthermore, the most differentially expressed circRNAs within all the comparisons were annotated in detail with circRNA/miRNA interaction information using miRNA target prediction software. In conclusion, the present study provides novel insight into the role of circRNAs in macrophage differentiation and polarization.},

Based on mRNA expression in the network, three potential drugs, quinacridine, thalidomide and zonisamide, were screened for the treatment of osteosarcoma. Among them, quinacridine and thalidomide have been proved to have anti-tumor effects in previous studies, while zonisamide has not been reported.

	abstract = {Background. Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a progressive cardiovascular disease, which is a permanent and localized dilatation of the abdominal aorta with potentially fatal consequence of aortic rupture. Dysregulation of circRNAs is correlated with the development of various pathological events in cardiovascular diseases. However, the function of circRNAs in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is unknown and remains to be explored. This study is aimed at determining the regulatory mechanisms of circRNAs in AAAs. This study was aimed at exploring the underlying molecular mechanisms of abdominal aortic aneurysms based on the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory hypothesis of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA. Methods. The expression profiles of circRNAs (GSE144431), miRNAs (GSE62179), and mRNAs (GSE7084, GSE57691, and GSE47472) in human tissue sample from the aneurysm group and normal group were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, respectively. The circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed by using Cytoscape 3.7.2 software; then, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by using the STRING database, and the hub genes were identified by using the cytoHubba plug-in. The circRNA-miRNA-hub gene regulatory subnetwork was formed to understand the regulatory axis of hub genes in AAAs. Results. The present study identified 40 differentially expressed circRNAs (DECs) in the GSE144431, 90 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRs) in the GSE62179, and 168 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) with the same direction regulation (130 downregulated and 38 upregulated) in the GSE7084, GSE57691, and GSE47472 datasets identified regarding AAAs. The miRNA response elements (MREs) of three DECs were then predicted. Four overlapping miRNAs were obtained by intersecting the predicted miRNA and DEmiRs. Then, 17 overlapping mRNAs were obtained by intersecting the predicted target mRNAs of 4 miRNAs with 168 DEGs. Furthermore, the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed through 3 circRNAs, 4 miRNAs, and 17 mRNAs, and three hub genes (SOD2, CCR7, and PGRMC1) were identified. Simultaneously, functional enrichment and pathway analysis were performed within genes in the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Three of them (SOD2, CCR7, and PGRMC1) were suggested to be crucial based on functional enrichment, protein-protein interaction, and ceRNA network analysis. Furthermore, the expression of SOD2 and CCR7 may be regulated by hsa\_circ\_0011449/hsa\_circ\_0081968/hsa-let-7f-5p; the expression of PGRMC1 may be regulated by hsa\_circ\_0011449/hsa\_circ\_0081968-hsa-let-7f-5p/hsa-let-7e-5p. Conclusion. In conclusion, the ceRNA interaction axis we identified may be an important target for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. This study provided further understanding of the potential pathogenesis from the perspective of the circRNA-related competitive endogenous RNA network in AAAs.},

	abstract = {To explore the potential role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in children developing very early-onset schizophrenia (VEOS). Total RNA was extracted from the plasma samples of 10 VEOS patients and eight healthy controls. Expression profiles of circRNAs, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were analyzed using RNA-seq. The interaction networks between miRNAs and targets were predicted using the miRanda tool. A differentially expressed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA (ceRNA) network was further constructed. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of the target mRNAs in the ceRNA network were performed to predict the potential functions of their host genes. The patient group and the control group were also compared on the regulatory patterns of circRNAs on mRNAs. 1934 circRNAs were identified from the samples and reported for the first time in schizophrenia. The circRNA expression levels were lower in the VEOS group than in the healthy control group, and 1889 circRNAs were expressed only in the control group. Differential expression analysis (i.e., log2fold change {\textgreater} 1.5, p 0.05) identified 235 circRNAs (1 up-regulated, 234 down-regulated), 11 miRNAs (7 up-regulated, 4 down-regulated), and 2,308 mRNAs (1906 up-regulated, 402 down-regulated) respectively. In VEOS, a ceRNA network with 10 down-regulated circRNA targets, 6 up-regulated miRNAs, and 47 down-regulated mRNAs was constructed. The target genes were involved in the membrane, the signal transduction, and the cytoskeleton and transport pathways. Finally, different expression correlation patterns of circRNA and mRNA in the network were observed between the patient group and the control group. The current research is the first to reveal the differentially expressed circRNAs in the plasma of VEOS patients. A circRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was also conducted in this study. It may be implied that the circRNAs in this network are potential diagnostic biomarkers for VEOS and they play an important role in the onset and development of VEOS symptoms.},

	abstract = {Circular (circ)RNAs have emerged as novel regulators of gene expression through various mechanisms. However, most publications focus on functional circRNAs regulating target gene expression by interacting with micro (mi)RNAs and acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Although the theory of miRNA sponging by ceRNAs suggests the inhibition of miRNA activity, many studies are biased toward the selection of miRNAs showing a reverse expression pattern compared with circRNA expression. Although several computational tools and molecular assays have been used to predict and validate the interaction of miRNAs with circRNAs, the actual validation of functional in vivo interactions needs careful consideration of molecular experiments with specific controls. As extensive research is being performed on circRNA, many questions arise on the functional significance of circRNA–miRNA interactions. We hope the critical discussion on the criteria for selecting circRNA–miRNA pairs for functional analysis and providing standard methods for validating circRNA–miRNA interactions will advance our understanding of circRNAs as novel gene regulators.

Along with transcriptional and translational regulation, the cell relies also on post-transcriptional modulation to quickly adapt the translation of essential proteins. MicroRNAs play an important role in the regulation of protein translation, and their availability is tightly regulated by RNA competing mechanisms often mediated by long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). In our paper, we simulated the response to growth adverse condition by bimiralisib, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, in diffuse large B cell lymphoma cell lines, and we studied post-transcriptional regulation by the differential analysis of exonic and intronic RNA expression. In particular, we observed the upregulation of a lncRNA, lncTNK2-2:1, which correlated with the stabilization of transcripts involved in the regulation of translation and DNA damage after bimiralisib treatment. We identified miR-21-3p as miRNA likely sponged by lncTNK2-2:1, with consequent stabilization of the mRNA of p53, which is a master regulator of cell growth in response to DNA damage.},

Notably, circRNAs can interact with miRNAs, influencing their specific mRNA targets’ levels and shaping a competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNA) network. However, these interactions and their respective functions remain largely unexplored in ischemic heart failure (IHF). This study is aimed at identifying circRNA-centered ceRNA networks in non-end-stage IHF. Approximately 662 circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interactions were identified in the heart by combining state-of-the-art bioinformatics tools with experimental data. Importantly, KEGG terms of the enriched mRNA indicated CVD-related signaling pathways. A specific network centered on circBPTF was validated experimentally. The levels of let-7a-5p, miR-18a-3p, miR-146b-5p, and miR-196b-5p were enriched in circBPTF pull-down experiments, and circBPTF silencing inhibited the expression of HDAC9 and LRRC17, which are targets of miR-196b-5p. Furthermore, as suggested by the enriched pathway terms of the circBPTF ceRNA network, circBPTF inhibition elicited endothelial cell cycle arrest. circBPTF expression increased in endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia, and its upregulation was confirmed in cardiac samples of 36 end-stage IHF patients compared to healthy controls. In conclusion, circRNAs act as miRNA sponges, regulating the functions of multiple mRNA targets, thus providing a novel vision of HF pathogenesis and laying the theoretical foundation for further experimental studies.},

Nelumbo nucifera (lotus), a horticulturally important plant, differentiates into a temperate ecotype of enlarged rhizomes and a tropical ecotype of thin rhizomes. Nevertheless, whether and how ncRNAs can be rewired in expression and differentially methylated contributing to adaptive divergence of this storage organ in lotus ecotypes is unclear. Herein, we study the expression behaviors and DNA methylation patterns of ncRNAs in temperate and tropical lotus rhizomes. By whole transcriptome sequencing, we found both mRNAs and lncRNAs have divergent expression patterns between ecotypes, whereas miRNAs and circRNAs tended to be accession-specific or noisier in expression. The differentially expressed ncRNAs are involved in phenotypic differentiation of lotus rhizome between ecotypes, as the genes that interacted with them in the competing endogenous RNA network are enriched in functions including carbohydrate metabolism and plant hormone signaling, being critical to rhizome enlargement. Intriguingly, ncRNA-targeted genes are less prone to show positive selection or differential expression during ecotypic divergence due to constraints from ncRNA-mRNA interactions. The methylation levels of ncRNAs generally tend to be higher in temperate lotus than in tropical lotus, and differential methylation of lncRNAs also tends to have expression changes. Overall, our study of ncRNAs and their targets highlights the role of ncRNAs in rhizome growth variation between lotus ecotypes through expression rewiring and methylation modification.},

Here we describe psirc, a method that can identify full-length circRNA isoforms and quantify their expression levels from RNA sequencing data. We confirm the effectiveness and computational efficiency of psirc using both simulated and actual experimental data. Applying psirc on transcriptome profiles from nasopharyngeal carcinoma and normal nasopharynx samples, we discover and validate circRNA isoforms differentially expressed between the two groups.

	abstract = {Precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a critical step in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, providing significant expansion of the functional proteome of eukaryotic organisms with limited gene numbers. Split eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences or introns disrupting protein-coding exons, and intron removal occurs by repeated assembly of a large and highly dynamic ribonucleoprotein complex termed the spliceosome, which is composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5. Biochemical studies over the past 10 years have allowed the isolation as well as compositional, functional, and structural analysis of splicing complexes at distinct stages along the spliceosome cycle. The average human gene contains eight exons and seven introns, producing an average of three or more alternatively spliced mRNA isoforms. Recent high-throughput sequencing studies indicate that 100\% of human genes produce at least two alternative mRNA isoforms. Mechanisms of alternative splicing include RNA–protein interactions of splicing factors with regulatory sites termed silencers or enhancers, RNA–RNA base-pairing interactions, or chromatin-based effects that can change or determine splicing patterns. Disease-causing mutations can often occur in splice sites near intron borders or in exonic or intronic RNA regulatory silencer or enhancer elements, as well as in genes that encode splicing factors. Together, these studies provide mechanistic insights into how spliceosome assembly, dynamics, and catalysis occur; how alternative splicing is regulated and evolves; and how splicing can be disrupted by cis- and trans-acting mutations leading to disease states. These findings make the spliceosome an attractive new target for small-molecule, antisense, and genome-editing therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {The 5′ mRNA cap structure is essential for efficient gene expression from yeast to human. It plays a critical role in all aspects of the life cycle of an mRNA molecule. Capping occurs co-transcriptionally on the nascent pre-mRNA as it emerges from the RNA exit channel of RNA polymerase II. The cap structure protects mRNAs from degradation by exonucleases and promotes transcription, polyadenylation, splicing, and nuclear export of mRNA and U-rich, capped snRNAs. In addition, the cap structure is required for the optimal translation of the vast majority of cellular mRNAs, and it also plays a prominent role in the expression of eukaryotic, viral, and parasite mRNAs. Cap-binding proteins specifically bind to the cap structure and mediate its functions in the cell. Two major cellular cap-binding proteins have been described to date: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in the cytoplasm and nuclear cap binding complex (nCBC), a nuclear complex consisting of a cap-binding subunit cap-binding protein 20 (CBP 20) and an auxiliary protein cap-binding protein 80 (CBP 80). nCBC plays an important role in various aspects of nuclear mRNA metabolism such as pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear export, whereas eIF4E acts primarily as a facilitator of mRNA translation. In this review, we highlight recent findings on the role of the cap structure and cap-binding proteins in the regulation of gene expression. We also describe emerging regulatory pathways that control mRNA capping and cap-binding proteins in the cell.

	abstract = {Poly(A) tails, present on almost every eukaryotic mRNA, were discovered over 50 years ago. Early experiments led to the hypothesis that poly(A) tails and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein promote translation and prevent mRNA degradation, but the details remained unclear. More recent data suggest that the role of poly(A) tails is much more complex: poly(A)-binding protein can stimulate poly(A) tail removal (deadenylation), and the poly(A) tails of stable, highly-translated mRNAs at steady state are much shorter than expected. Moreover, the rate of translation elongation impacts deadenylation. Together, the interplay between poly(A) tails, poly(A)-binding protein, translation, and mRNA decay plays a major role in regulating gene expression. In this review, we summarize recent work that is revolutionizing the field and changing our perspective on the roles of poly(A) tails in the cytoplasm. Specifically, we discuss the roles of poly(A) tails in translation and mRNA stability, and how poly(A) tails are removed by exonucleases (deadenylases) including Ccr4-Not and Pan2-Pan3. We also cover major topics of current research, including how deadenylation rate is determined, the integration of deadenylation with other cellular processes, and the function of the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein. Finally, we provide an outlook for the future of research in this area.},

	abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing, a dynamic process of intron removal and exon joining, is governed by a combinatorial control exerted by overlapping cis-elements that are unique to each exon and its flanking intronic sequences. Splicing cis-elements are usually 4-to-8-nucleotide-long linear motifs that provide binding sites for specific proteins. Pre-mRNA splicing is also influenced by secondary and higher order RNA structures that affect accessibility of splicing cis-elements. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that block splicing cis-elements and/or affect RNA structure have been shown to modulate splicing in vivo. Therefore, ASO-based strategies have emerged as a powerful tool for therapeutic manipulation of splicing in pathological conditions. Here we describe an ASO-based approach to increase the production of the full-length SMN2 mRNA in spinal muscular atrophy patient cells.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is a major contributor to both proteomic diversity and control of gene expression levels. Splicing is tightly regulated in different tissues and developmental stages, and its disruption can lead to a wide range of human diseases. An important long-term goal in the splicing field is to determine a set of rules or “code” for splicing that will enable prediction of the splicing pattern of any primary transcript from its sequence. Outside of the core splice site motifs, the bulk of the information required for splicing is thought to be contained in exonic and intronic cis-regulatory elements that function by recruitment of sequence-specific RNA-binding protein factors that either activate or repress the use of adjacent splice sites. Here, we summarize the current state of knowledge of splicing cis-regulatory elements and their context-dependent effects on splicing, emphasizing recent global/genome-wide studies and open questions.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing is a key process of multi-exonic gene expression during pre-mRNA maturation. In this process, particular exons of a gene will be included within or excluded from the final matured mRNA, and the resulting transcripts generate diverse protein isoforms. Recent evidence demonstrates that approximately 95\% of human genes with multiple exons undergo alternative splicing during pre-mRNA maturation. Thus, alternative splicing plays a critical role in physiological processes and cell development programs, and.dysregulation of alternative splicing is highly associated with human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the regulation of alternative splicing, examine the relationship between alternative splicing and human diseases, and describe several approaches that modify alternative splicing, which could aid in human disease diagnosis and therapy.},

The spliceosome is the multiprotein-RNA complex charged with the intricate task of alternative splicing. Aberrant splicing can arise from abnormal spliceosomes or splicing factors and drive cancer development and progression. This review will provide an overview of the alternative splicing process and aberrant splicing in cancer, with a focus on serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins and their recently reported roles in cancer development and progression and beyond. Recent mapping of the spliceosome, its associated splicing factors, and their relationship to cancer have opened the door to novel therapeutic approaches that capitalize on the widespread influence of alternative splicing. We conclude by discussing small molecule inhibitors of the spliceosome that have been identified in an evolving era of cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Alternative splicing of precursor mRNA is an essential mechanism to increase the complexity of gene expression, and it plays an important role in cellular differentiation and organism development. Regulation of alternative splicing is a complicated process in which numerous interacting components are at work, including cis‑acting elements and trans‑acting factors, and is further guided by the functional coupling between transcription and splicing. Additional molecular features, such as chromatin structure, RNA structure and alternative transcription initiation or alternative transcription termination, collaborate with these basic components to generate the protein diversity due to alternative splicing. All these factors contributing to this one fundamental biological process add up to a mechanism that is critical to the proper functioning of cells. Any corruption of the process may lead to disruption of normal cellular function and the eventuality of disease. Cancer is one of those diseases, where alternative splicing may be the basis for the identification of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as new strategies for therapy. Thus, an in‑depth understanding of alternative splicing regulation has the potential not only to elucidate fundamental biological principles, but to provide solutions for various diseases.},

	abstract = {Numerous RNA binding proteins are deposited onto an mRNA transcript to modulate posttranscriptional processing events ensuring proper mRNA maturation. Defining the interplay between RNA binding proteins that couple mRNA biogenesis events is crucial for understanding how gene expression is regulated. To explore how RNA binding proteins control mRNA processing, we investigated a role for the evolutionarily conserved polyadenosine RNA binding protein, Nab2, in mRNA maturation within the nucleus. This study reveals that nab2 mutant cells accumulate intron-containing pre-mRNA in vivo. We extend this analysis to identify genetic interactions between mutant alleles of nab2 and genes encoding a splicing factor, MUD2, and RNA exosome, RRP6, with in vivo consequences of altered pre-mRNA splicing and poly(A) tail length control. As further evidence linking Nab2 proteins to splicing, an unbiased proteomic analysis of vertebrate Nab2, ZC3H14, identifies physical interactions with numerous components of the spliceosome. We validated the interaction between ZC3H14 and U2AF2/U2AF65. Taking all the findings into consideration, we present a model where Nab2/ZC3H14 interacts with spliceosome components to allow proper coupling of splicing with subsequent mRNA processing steps contributing to a kinetic proofreading step that allows properly processed mRNA to exit the nucleus and escape Rrp6-dependent degradation.},

	abstract = {The EJC is deposited 24 nucleotides upstream of spliced junctions during splicing. It accompanies mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is removed by the first round of translation, and recycled back into the nucleus.The core of the EJC consists of four proteins. Structural studies revealed that the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A3 functions as a clamp that binds RNA in a sequence-unspecific manner. MAGOH and Y14 form a heterodimer to lock eIF4A3 onto the mRNA, whereas MLN51 contacts eIF4A3 and the mRNA and provides further stability.The core complex acts as a binding platform for peripheral factors involved in splicing, transport, translation and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). The composition of peripheral factors depends on the different stages of mRNA processing.The EJC has several functions in regulating different post-transcriptional processes, including splicing, cellular localization, translation and NMD.The EJC is not present at every exon junction, and it does not always bind at the canonical position. This differential loading could impact the composition and functions of different EJCs.The EJC acts as a central node of post-transcriptional gene regulation, and changes in EJC protein expression levels lead to several developmental defects and diseases.},
