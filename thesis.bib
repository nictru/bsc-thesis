	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNA molecules formed by joining a downstream 3 splice donor site and an upstream 5 splice acceptor site. Several recent studies have identified circRNAs as potential biomarker for different diseases. A number of methods are available for the identification of circRNAs. The circRNA identification methods cannot provide full-length sequences. Reconstruction of the full-length sequences is crucial for the downstream analyses of circRNA research including differential expression analysis, circRNA-miRNA interaction analysis and other functional studies of the circRNAs. However, a limited number of methods are available in the literature for the reconstruction of full-length circRNA sequences. We developed a new method, circRNA-full, for full-length circRNA sequence reconstruction utilizing chimeric alignment information from the STAR aligner. To evaluate our method, we used full-length circRNA sequences produced by isocirc and ciri-long using long-reads RNA-seq data. Our method achieved better reconstruction rate, precision, sensitivity and F1 score than the existing full-length circRNA sequence reconstruction tool ciri-full for both human and mouse data.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shed light on the potential of circular RNA (circRNA) as a biomarker for disease diagnosis and as a nucleic acid vaccine. The exploration of these functionalities requires correct circRNA full-length sequences; however, existing assembly tools can only correctly assemble some circRNAs, and their performance can be further improved. Here, we introduce a novel feature known as the junction contig (JC), which is an extension of the back-splice junction (BSJ). Leveraging the strengths of both BSJ and JC, we present a novel method called JCcirc (https://github.com/cbbzhang/JCcirc). It enables efficient reconstruction of all types of circRNA full-length sequences and their alternative isoforms using splice graphs and fragment coverage. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of JCcirc over existing methods on human simulation datasets, and its average F1 score surpasses CircAST by 0.40 and outperforms both CIRI-full and circRNAfull by 0.13. For circRNAs below 400 bp, 400–800 bp, 800 bp–1200 bp and above 1200 bp, the correct assembly rates are 0.13, 0.09, 0.04 and 0.03 higher, respectively, than those achieved by existing methods. Moreover, JCcirc also outperforms existing assembly tools on other five model species datasets and real sequencing datasets. These results show that JCcirc is a robust tool for accurately assembling circRNA full-length sequences, laying the foundation for the functional analysis of circRNAs.},

We showed the functionality of the circRNA-sponging pipeline using RNA sequencing data from brain tissues, where we identified two distinct types of circRNAs characterized by a specific ratio of the number of the binding site to the length of the transcript. The circRNA-sponging pipeline is the first end-to-end pipeline to identify circRNAs and their sponging systematically with raw total RNA-seq and miRNA-seq files, allowing us to better indicate the functional impact of circRNAs as a routine aspect in transcriptomic research.https://github.com/biomedbigdata/circRNA-sponging.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics Advances online.},

Finally, we evaluated the effect of circTADA2A-E6 on miR-203a-3p and its target gene SOCS3. We detected two circRNAs, circTADA2A-E6 and circTADA2A-E5/E6, which were among the top five differentially expressed circRNAs in breast cancer. They were consistently and significantly decreased in a large cohort of breast cancer patients, and their downregulation was associated with poor patient survival for TNBC. Especially, circTADA2A-E6 suppressed in vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity and possessed tumor-suppressor capability. circTADA2A-E6 preferentially acted as a miR-203a-3p sponge to restore the expression of miRNA target gene SOCS3, resulting in a less aggressive oncogenic phenotype. circTADA2As as promising prognostic biomarkers in TNBC patients, and therapeutic targeting of circTADA2As/miRNA/mRNA network may be a potential strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.},

To investigate the regulatory effect of circRPPH1 on cellular behaviors of breast cancer and the potential mechanism, the expression of circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p in breast cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The regulatory effects of the circRPPH1/miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis on cellular behaviors of breast cancer cells were evaluated through functional experiments in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The relationship between circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p/YAP1 was assessed using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. PCR results showed that circRPPH1 levels were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and breast cancer cells. Functionally, circRPPH1 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cell lines and tumor growth in vivo. Regarding the mechanism, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays showed that circRPPH1 was capable of sponging miR-556-5p to increase expression of the oncogene YAP1. Our data reveal that circRPPH1 plays a vital regulatory role in breast cancer via the miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs are a large group of noncoding RNAs that are widely expressed in mammalian cells. Genome-wide analyses have revealed abundant and evolutionarily conserved circular RNAs across species, which suggest specific physiological roles of these species. Using a microarray approach, we detected increased expression of a circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 in eight breast cancer cell lines and in patients with breast carcinoma. Silencing circ-Dnmt1 inhibited cell proliferation and survival. Ectopic circ-Dnmt1 increased the proliferative and survival capacities of breast cancer cells by stimulating cellular autophagy. We found that circ-Dnmt1-mediated autophagy was essential in inhibiting cellular senescence and increasing tumor xenograft growth. We further found that ectopically expressed circ-Dnmt1 could interact with both p53 and AUF1, promoting the nuclear translocation of both proteins. Nuclear translocation of p53 induced cellular autophagy while AUF1 nuclear translocation reduced Dnmt1 mRNA instability, resulting in increased Dnmt1 translation. From here, functional Dnmt1 could then translocate into the nucleus, inhibiting p53 transcription. Computational algorithms revealed that both p53 and AUF1 could bind to different regions of circ-Dnmt1 RNA. Our results showed that the highly expressed circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 could bind to and regulate oncogenic proteins in breast cancer cells. Thus circ-Dnmt1 appears to be an oncogenic circular RNA with potential for further preclinical research.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently identified class of RNAs produced via back-splicing and covalent linkage between RNA ends, resulting in a circularized RNA molecule. Physiologically, circRNAs are known to influence a variety of biological pathways, and can also regulate transcription, post-transcription, RNA splicing, or interaction with other proteins or microRNAs (miRNAs). Functionally, circRNAs are known to competitively bind to various other RNA molecules including miRNAs and other competing endogenous RNA such as long noncoding RNA, thereby significantly influencing gene expression. Since gene expression is a crucial factor that underlies economically important livestock traits, it is likely that circRNAs significantly influence livestock traits like growth, milk production, reproduction, meat quality, hair follicle growth, and gametogenesis. Thousands of circRNAs have been recognized in different species of animals, and some of these circRNAs have also been shown to regulate stress responses that may be crucial for animal welfare. Therefore, in this review, we aim to highlight the biogenesis of circRNAs, along with its potential implications for livestock. The presented summary would offer a fundamental understanding of the molecular machinery that underlies circRNAs and associated biological phenomena and emphasize the need for further explorations into the role of circRNAs in the other productive, reproductive, and physiological attributes in animals.},

Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are the most common pathogens of mastitis in dairy cows and usually cause subclinical or clinical mastitis. CircRNAs and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) play important roles in immunological diseases. However, the mechanisms by which m6A modifies circRNA in bovine mammary epithelial cells remain poorly understood. The aim of our study was to investigate m6A-modified circRNAs in bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) injured by S. aureus and E. coli. The profile of m6A-modified circRNA showed a total of 1,599 m6A peaks within 1,035 circRNAs in the control group, 35 peaks within 32 circRNAs in the S. aureus group, and 1,016 peaks within 728 circRNAs in the E. coli group. Compared with the control group, 67 peaks within 63 circRNAs were significantly different in the S. aureus group, and 192 peaks within 137 circRNAs were significantly different in the E. coli group. Furthermore, we found the source genes of these differentially m6A-modified circRNAs in the S. aureus and E. coli groups with similar functions according to GO and KEGG analyses, which were mainly associated with cell injury, such as inflammation, apoptosis, and autophagy. CircRNA–miRNA–mRNA interaction networks predicted the potential circRNA regulation mechanism in S. aureus- and E. coli-induced cell injury. We found that the mRNAs in the networks, such as BCL2, MIF, and TNFAIP8L2, greatly participated in the MAPK, WNT, and inflammation pathways. This is the first report on m6A-modified circRNA regulation of cells under S. aureus and E. coli treatment, and sheds new light on potential mechanisms and targets from the perspective of epigenetic modification in mastitis and other inflammatory diseases.},

	abstract = {Bovine mastitis is an inflammatory response of mammary glands caused by pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli (E. coli). As a key virulence factor of E. coli, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) triggers innate immune responses via activation of the toll-like-receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway. However, the molecular regulatory network of LPS-induced bovine mastitis has yet to be fully mapped. In this study, bovine mammary epithelial cell lines MAC-T were exposed to LPS for 0, 6 and 12 h to assess the expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) were filtered out of the raw data for subsequent analyses. A total of 2,257 lncRNAs, including 210 annotated and 2047 novel lncRNAs were detected in all samples. A large proportion of lncRNAs were present in a high abundance, and 112 DElncRNAs were screened out at different time points. Compared with 0 h, there were 22 up- and 25 down-regulated lncRNAs in the 6 h of post-infection (hpi) group, and 27 up- and 22 down-regulated lncRNAs in the 12 hpi group. Compared with the 6 hpi group, 32 lncRNAs were up-regulated and 25 lncRNAs were down-regulated in the 12 hpi group. These DElncRNAs are involved in the regulation of a variety of immune-related processes including inflammatory responses bMECs exposed to LPS. Furthermore, lncRNA TCONS\_00039271 and TCONS\_00139850 were respectively significance down- and up-regulated, and their target genes involve in regulating inflammation-related signaling pathways (i.e.,Notch, NF-κB, MAPK, PI3K-Akt and mTOR signaling pathway), thereby regulating the occurrence and development of E. coli mastitis. This study provides a resource for lncRNA research on the molecular regulation of bovine mastitis},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that the occurrence and development of tumours are associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the expression profile and clinical significance of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours remain unclear. In this paper, we collected tissue samples from three dogs with canine mammary tumours and analysed the expression profiles of circRNAs in these samples using high-throughput sequencing technology. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses revealed 14 biological processes associated with these genes, and 11 of these genes were selected for qRT-PCR to verify their authenticity. CircRNAs have sponge adsorption to miRNAs, so we constructed a circRNA-miRNA network map using Cytoscape software. As a result, we identified a total of 14,851 circRNAs in canine mammary tumours and its adjacent normal tissues. Of these, 106 were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.05), and 64 were upregulated and 42 were downregulated. The GO analysis revealed that the biological processes involved were mainly in the regulation of the secretory pathway, the regulation of neurotransmitter secretion and the positive regulation of phagocytosis. Most of these biological pathways were associated with the cGMP-PKG (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signalling pathway, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signalling pathway and the oxytocin signalling pathway. After screening, source genes closely associated with canine mammary tumours were found to include RYR2, PDE4D, ROCK2, CREB3L2 and UBA3, and associated circRNAs included chr27:26618544-26687235-, chr26:8194880-8201833+ and chr17:7960861-7967766-. In conclusion, we reveals the expression profile of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours. In addition, some circRNAs might be used as potential biomarkers for molecular diagnosis.},

By constructing pseudo-circular reference for re-alignment of RNA-seq reads and employing sophisticated statistical models to correct RNase R treatment biases, CIRIquant can provide more accurate expression values for circRNAs with significantly reduced false discovery rate. We further develop a one-stop differential expression analysis pipeline implementing two independent measures, which helps unveil the regulation of competitive splicing between circRNAs and their linear counterparts. We apply CIRIquant to RNA-seq datasets of hepatocellular carcinoma, and characterize two important groups of linear-circular switching and circular transcript usage switching events, which demonstrate the promising ability to explore extensive transcriptomic changes in liver tumorigenesis.},

Circular RNAs are a recently identified group of non-coding RNA with a significant role in disease development with potential utility in diagnosis/prognosis in cancer. In this study, we identified 26 differentially expressed circular RNAs associated with early-stage breast cancer. RNA sequencing and two circRNA detection tools (find\_circ and DCC) were used to understand the circRNA expression signature in breast cancer. We identified hsa\_circ\_0006743 (circJMJD1C) and hsa\_circ\_0002496 (circAPPBP1) to be significantly up-regulated in early-stage breast cancer tissues. Co-expression analysis identified four pairs of circRNA-miRNA (hsa\_circ\_0023990 : hsa-miR-548b-3p, hsa\_circ\_0016601 : hsa\_miR-1246, hsa\_circ\_0001946 : hsa-miR-1299 and hsa\_circ\_0000117:hsa-miR-502-5p) having potential interaction. The miRNA target prediction and network analysis revealed mRNA possibly regulated by circRNAs. We have thus identified circRNAs of diagnostic implications in breast cancer and also observed circRNA-miRNA interaction which could be involved in breast cancer development.},

Over the past years, due to their intrinsic stability and resistance to ribonucleases, particular attention has been drawn to their use as reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. However, there are some critical caveats to their utility in the clinic. Their circular shape limits their annotation and a complete functional elucidation is lacking.

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel type of endogenous RNAs, have become a subject of intensive research. It has been found that circRNAs are important players in cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis, as well as disease development. Moreover, the expression of circRNAs is usually not correlated with their parental gene expression, indicating that they are not only a steady-state by-product of mRNA splicing but a product of variable splicing under novel regulation. Sequence conservation analysis has also demonstrated that circRNAs have important non-coding functions. CircRNAs exist as a covalently closed loop form in mammalian cells, where they regulate cellular transcription and translation processes. CircRNAs are built from pre-messenger RNAs, and their biogenesis involves back-splicing, which is catalyzed by spliceosomes. The splicing reaction gives rise to three different types of intronic, exotic and exon–intron circular RNAs. Due to higher nuclease stability and longer half lives in cells, circRNAs are more stable than linear RNAs and have enormous clinical advantage for use as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for disease. In recent years, it has been reported that circRNAs in stem cells play a crucial role in stem cell function. In this article, we reviewed the general feature of circRNAs and the distinct roles of circRNAs in stem cell biology, including regulation of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. CircRNAs have shown unique expression profiles during differentiation of stem cells and could serve as promising biomarkers of these cells. As circRNAs play pivotal roles in stem cell regulation as well as the development and progression of various diseases, we also discuss opportunities and challenges of circRNA-based treatment strategies in future effective therapies for promising clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules that have been linked to various diseases, including cancer. However, a precise function and working mechanism are lacking for the larger majority. Following many different experimental and computational approaches to identify circRNAs, multiple circRNA databases were developed as well. Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the current circRNA databases, which substantially hamper progression in the field. First, as the overlap in content is limited, a true reference set of circRNAs is lacking. This results from the low abundance and highly specific expression of circRNAs, and varying sequencing methods, data-analysis pipelines, and circRNA detection tools. A second major issue is the use of ambiguous nomenclature. Thus, redundant or even conflicting names for circRNAs across different databases contribute to the reproducibility crisis. Third, circRNA databases, in essence, rely on the position of the circRNA back-splice junction, whereas alternative splicing could result in circRNAs with different length and sequence. To uniquely identify a circRNA molecule, the full circular sequence is required. Fourth, circRNA databases annotate circRNAs’ microRNA binding and protein-coding potential, but these annotations are generally based on presumed circRNA sequences. Finally, several databases are not regularly updated, contain incomplete data or suffer from connectivity issues. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of the current circRNA databases and their content, features, and usability. In addition to discussing the current issues regarding circRNA databases, we come with important suggestions to streamline further research in this growing field.},

	abstract = {Thousands of eukaryotic protein-coding genes generate circular RNAs that have covalently linked ends and are resistant to degradation by exonucleases. To prove their circularity as well as biochemically enrich these transcripts, it has become standard in the field to use the 3′-5′ exonuclease RNase R. Here, we demonstrate that standard protocols involving RNase R can fail to digest \&gt;20\% of all highly expressed linear RNAs, but these shortcomings can largely be overcome. RNAs with highly structured 3′ ends, including snRNAs and histone mRNAs, are naturally resistant to RNase R, but can be efficiently degraded once a poly(A) tail has been added to their ends. In addition, RNase R stalls in the body of many polyadenylated mRNAs, especially at G-rich sequences that have been previously annotated as G-quadruplex (G4) structures. Upon replacing K+ (which stabilizes G4s) with Li+ in the reaction buffer, we find that RNase R is now able to proceed through these sequences and fully degrade the mRNAs in their entirety. In total, our results provide important improvements to the current methods used to isolate circular RNAs as well as a way to reveal RNA structures that may naturally inhibit degradation by cellular exonucleases.},

In metazoans, circular RNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, are highly stable, and accumulate with age in neural tissues. circRNA biogenesis can regulate the production of the linear RNA counterpart in cis as back-splicing competes with linear splicing. Recent reports also demonstrate functions for some circRNAs in trans: Certain circRNAs interact with microRNAs, some are translated, and circRNAs have been shown to regulate immune responses and behavior. Here, we review current knowledge about animal circRNAs and summarize new insights into potential circRNA functions, concepts of their origin, and possible future directions in the field.},

	abstract = {A primary challenge in the analysis of RNA-seq data is to identify differentially expressed genes or transcripts while controlling for technical biases. Ideally, a statistical testing procedure should incorporate the inherent uncertainty of the abundance estimates arising from the quantification step. Most popular methods for RNA-seq differential expression analysis fit a parametric model to the counts for each gene or transcript, and a subset of methods can incorporate uncertainty. Previous work has shown that nonparametric models for RNA-seq differential expression may have better control of the false discovery rate, and adapt well to new data types without requiring reformulation of a parametric model. Existing nonparametric models do not take into account inferential uncertainty, leading to an inflated false discovery rate, in particular at the transcript level. We propose a nonparametric model for differential expression analysis using inferential replicate counts, extending the existing SAMseq method to account for inferential uncertainty. We compare our method, Swish, with popular differential expression analysis methods. Swish has improved control of the false discovery rate, in particular for transcripts with high inferential uncertainty. We apply Swish to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, assessing differential expression between sub-populations of cells, and compare its performance to the Wilcoxon test.},

These observations have sparked great interest into this class of previously underappreciated RNAs and prompted the development of new experimental approaches to study them, especially methods to measure or modulate circular RNA expression levels. Nonetheless, each of these approaches has caveats and potential pitfalls that must be controlled for when designing experiments and interpreting results. Here, we provide practical advice, tips, and suggested guidelines for performing robust identification, validation, and functional characterization of circular RNAs.

In sheep, little is known about the role of circular RNAs in mammary gland tissue, and therefore an RNA sequencing approach was used to compare mammary gland tissue expression of circular RNAs in 9 Small Tail Han sheep at peak lactation, and subsequently when they were not lactating. These 9 sheep had their RNA pooled for analysis into 3 libraries from peak lactation and 3 from the nonlactating period. A total of 3,278 and 1,756 circular RNAs were identified in the peak lactation and nonlactating mammary gland tissues, respectively, and the expression and identity of 9 of them was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis and DNA sequencing. The type, chromosomal location and length of the circular RNAs identified were ascertained. Forty upregulated and one downregulated circular RNAs were characterized in the mammary gland tissue at peak lactation compared with the nonlactating mammary gland tissue. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that the parental genes of these differentially expressed circular RNAs were related to molecular function, binding, protein binding, ATP binding, and ion binding. Five differentially expression circular RNAs were selected for further analysis to predict their target microRNAs, and some microRNAs reportedly associated with the development of the mammary gland were found in the constructed circular RNA–microRNA network. This study reveals the expression profiles and characterization of circular RNAs at 2 key stages of mammary gland activity, thereby providing an improved understanding of the roles of circular RNAs in the mammary gland of sheep.},

Here we identified a circular RNA, circBtnl1, that is highly expressed in ISCs. Loss of circBtnl1 in mice enhanced ISC self‐renewal capacity and epithelial regeneration, without changes in mRNA and protein levels of its parental gene Btnl1. Mechanistically, circBtnl1 and Atf4 mRNA competitively bound the ATP‐dependent RNA helicase Ddx3y to impair the stability of Atf4 mRNA in wild‐type ISCs. Furthermore, ATF4 activated Sox9 transcription by binding to its promoter via a unique motif, to enhance the self‐renewal capacity and epithelial regeneration of ISCs. In contrast, circBtnl1 knockout promoted Atf4 mRNA stability and enhanced ATF4 expression, which caused Sox9 transcription to potentiate ISC stemness. These data indicate that circBtnl1‐mediated Atf4 mRNA decay suppresses Sox9 transcription that negatively modulates self‐renewal maintenance of ISCs., A newly identified circRNA, CircBtnl1 inhibits the self‐renewal of mouse intestinal stem cells through indirect suppression of Sox9 activity.},

Importantly, circRNAs have been shown to participate in regulating various biological processes. Functionally, circRNAs can influence cellular physiology through various molecular mechanisms, such as serving as a decoy for microRNAs or RNA-binding proteins to modulate gene expression or translation of regulatory proteins. The biogenesis of circRNAs is known to be tightly regulated by cis- (intronic complementary sequences) and/or trans-factors (splicing factors) that constitute a cell- and context-dependent regulatory layer in the control of gene expression. However, our understanding of the regulation and function of circRNAs is still limited. In this review, we summarize the current progress in elucidating the functional roles, mechanisms and biogenesis of circRNAs.

However, it remains unknown what regulates the biogenesis of these ORF-containing circRNAs, whether they are actually translated into proteins and what functions they play in specific physiological contexts. Here, we report that a large number of circRNAs are synthesized with increasing abundance when late pachytene spermatocytes develop into round and then elongating spermatids during murine spermatogenesis. For a subset of circRNAs, the back splicing appears to occur mostly at m6A-enriched sites, which are usually located around the start and stop codons in linear mRNAs. Consequently, approximately a half of these male germ cell circRNAs contain large ORFs with m6A-modified start codons in their junctions, features that have been recently shown to be associated with protein-coding potential. Hundreds of peptides encoded by the junction sequences of these circRNAs were detected using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, suggesting that these circRNAs can indeed be translated into proteins in both developing (spermatocytes and spermatids) and mature (spermatozoa) male germ cells. The present study discovered not only a novel role of m6A in the biogenesis of coding circRNAs, but also a potential mechanism to ensure stable and long-lasting protein production in the absence of linear mRNAs, i.e., through production of circRNAs containing large ORFs and m6A-modified start codons in junction sequences.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are currently classed as non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that, unlike linear RNAs, form covalently closed continuous loops and act as gene regulators in mammals. They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3′ and 5′ ends normally present in an RNA molecule have been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments. In addition, though originally thought to be non-coding, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that select circRNAs can be translated into functional proteins. Although much remains to be elucidated about circRNA biology and mechanisms of gene regulation, these ncRNAs are quickly emerging as potential disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cancer.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A circRNA is a type of endogenous noncoding RNA that consists of a closed circular RNA molecule formed by reverse splicing; these RNAs are widely distributed in a variety of biological cells. In contrast to linear RNAs, circRNAs have no 5′ cap or 3′ poly(A) tail. They have a stable structure, a high degree of conservation, and high stability, and they are richly and specifically expressed in certain tissues and developmental stages. CircRNAs play a very important role in the occurrence and progression of malignant tumors. According to their origins, circRNAs can be divided into four types: exon-derived circRNAs (ecRNAs), intron-derived circRNAs (ciRNAs), circRNAs containing both exons and introns (EIciRNAs) and intergenic circRNAs. A large number of studies have shown that circRNAs have a variety of biological functions, participate in the regulation of gene expression and play an important role in the occurrence and progression of tumors. In this paper, the structure and function of circRNAs are reviewed, along with their biological role in malignant tumors of the digestive tract, in order to provide a reference for the diagnosis and treatment of digestive system neoplasms.},

Recent studies indicated that some cytoplasmic circRNAs can be effectively translated into detectable peptides, which enlightened us on the importance of circRNAs in cellular physiology function. Internal Ribosome Entry site (IRES)- and N6-methyladenosines (m6A)-mediated cap-independent translation initiation have been suggested to be potential mechanism for circRNA translation. To date, several translated circRNAs have been uncovered to play pivotal roles in human cancers. In this review, we introduced the properties and functions of circRNAs, and characterized the possible mechanism of translation initiation and complexity of the translation ability of circRNAs. We summarized the emerging functions of circRNA-encoded proteins in human cancer. The works on circRNA translation will open a hidden human proteome, and enhance us to understand the importance of circRNAs in human cancer, which has been poorly explored so far.},

The vast majority of circRNAs are found in the cytoplasm, and some intron-containing circRNAs are localized in the nucleus. CircRNAs have been found to function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, interact with RBPs and translate proteins, and play an important regulatory role in the development and progression of cancer. CircRNAs exhibit tissue- and developmental stage–specific expression and are stable, with longer half-lives than linear RNAs. CircRNAs have great potential as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, which is highlighted by their detectability in tissues, especially in fluid biopsy samples such as plasma, saliva, and urine.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related death in the world, especially due to its frequency and ineffective therapeutically approaches in the late stages of the disease. Despite the recent advent of promising new targeted therapies, lung cancer diagnostic strategies still have difficulty in identifying the disease at an early stage. Therefore, the characterizations of more sensible and specific cancer biomarkers have become an important goal for clinicians. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a type of RNA with covalently closed continuous loop structures that display high structural resistance and tissue specificity pointed toward a potential biomarker role. Current investigations have identified that circRNAs have a prominent function in the regulation of oncogenic pathways, by regulating gene expression both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The aim of this review is to provide novel information regarding the implications of circRNAs in lung cancer, with an emphasis on the role in disease development and progression. Initially, we explored the potential utility of circRNAs as biomarkers, focusing on function, mechanisms, and correlation with disease progression in lung cancer. Further, we will describe the interaction between circRNAs and other non-coding species of RNA (particularly microRNA) and their biological significance in lung cancer. Describing the nature of these interactions and their therapeutic potential will provide additional insight regarding the altered molecular landscape of lung cancer and consolidate the potential clinical value of these circular transcripts.

CircRNAs have been shown to act as sponges for miRNAs and may also potentially sponge RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and are thus predicted to function as robust posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. The joint analysis of large-scale transcriptome data coupled with computational analyses represents a powerful approach to elucidate possible biological roles of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. Here, we present a new web tool, CircInteractome (circRNA interactome), for mapping RBP- and miRNA-binding sites on human circRNAs. CircInteractome searches public circRNA, miRNA, and RBP databases to provide bioinformatic analyses of binding sites on circRNAs and additionally analyzes miRNA and RBP sites on junction and junction-flanking sequences. CircInteractome also allows the user the ability to (1) identify potential circRNAs which can act as RBP sponges, (2) design junction-spanning primers for specific detection of circRNAs of interest, (3) design siRNAs for circRNA silencing, and (4) identify potential internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES). In sum, the web tool CircInteractome, freely accessible at http://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov, facilitates the analysis of circRNAs and circRNP biology.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading malignant tumor in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its pathogenesis involves multiple factors, including environment, lifestyle, and genetics. Continuing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs), as a novel non-coding RNA, constitute an important genetic variable in the pathogenesis of CRC. These circRNAs with covalently closed-loop structures exist objectively in organisms. They not only have the biological functions of regulating the expression of target genes, changing the activity of proteins, and translating proteins, but also play a key role in the proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of tumor cells. CRC is one of the most common cancers in which circRNAs are involved in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and drug resistance, and circRNAs have been demonstrated to function through crosstalk with multiple signaling pathways. Therefore, this review summarizes the biological and carcinogenic functions of circRNAs and their related PI3K/AKT, MAPK, Notch, JAK/STAT, Hippo/YAP, WNT/β-catenin, and VEGF signaling pathways in CRC.

Sequence annotation suggests that most circRNAs are generated from splicing in reversed orders across exons. However, the mechanisms of this backsplicing are largely unknown. Here we constructed a single exon minigene containing split GFP, and found that the pre-mRNA indeed produces circRNA through efficient backsplicing in human and Drosophila cells. The backsplicing is enhanced by complementary introns that form double-stranded RNA structure to bring splice sites in proximity, but such structure is not required. Moreover, backsplicing is regulated by general splicing factors and cis-elements, but with regulatory rules distinct from canonical splicing. The resulting circRNA can be translated to generate functional proteins. Unlike linear mRNA, poly-adenosine or poly-thymidine in 3′ UTR can inhibit circular mRNA translation. This study revealed that backsplicing can occur efficiently in diverse eukaryotes to generate circular mRNAs.},

The immunogenicity and protein expression stability of circRNA preparations is found to be dependent on purity, with small amounts of contaminating linear RNA leading to robust cellular immune responses. Unmodified circRNA is less immunogenic than unmodified linear mRNA in vitro, in part due to evasion of TLR sensing. Finally, we provide the first demonstration to our knowledge of exogenous circRNA delivery and translation in vivo, and we show that circRNA translation is extended in adipose tissue in comparison to unmodified and uridine-modified linear mRNAs.,

We discover that consensus m6A motifs are enriched in circRNAs and a single m6A site is sufficient to drive translation initiation. This m6A-driven translation requires initiation factor eIF4G2 and m6A reader YTHDF3, and is enhanced by methyltransferase METTL3/14, inhibited by demethylase FTO, and upregulated upon heat shock. Further analyses through polysome profiling, computational prediction and mass spectrometry reveal that m6A-driven translation of circRNAs is widespread, with hundreds of endogenous circRNAs having translation potential.

First, we engineer a self-splicing intron to efficiently circularize a wide range of RNAs up to 5 kb in length in vitro by rationally designing ubiquitous accessory sequences that aid in splicing. We maximize translation of functional protein from these circRNAs in eukaryotic cells, and we find that engineered circRNA purified by high performance liquid chromatography displays exceptional protein production qualities in terms of both quantity of protein produced and stability of production. This study pioneers the use of exogenous circRNA for robust and stable protein expression in eukaryotic cells and demonstrates that circRNA is a promising alternative to linear mRNA., Circular RNAs have recently been shown to have protein-coding potential.

They have been widely found in Populus euphratica Oliv. heteromorphic leaves (P. hl). To study the role of circRNAs related to transcription factors (TFs) in the morphogenesis of P. hl, the expression profiles of circRNAs in linear, lanceolate, ovate, and broad-ovate leaves of P. euphratica were elucidated by strand-specific sequencing. We identified and characterized 22 circRNAs related to TFs in P. hl at the four developmental stages. Using the competing endogenous RNAs hypothesis as a guide, we constructed circRNA–miRNA–TF mRNA regulatory networks, which indicated that circRNAs antagonized microRNAs (miRNAs), thereby influencing the expression of the miRNA target genes and playing a significant role in transcriptional regulation. Gene ontology annotation of the target TF genes predicted that these circRNAs were associated mainly with the regulation of leaf development, leaf morphogenesis, signal transduction, and response to abiotic stress. These findings implied that the circRNAs affected the size and number of cells in P. hl by regulating the expression of TF mRNAs.

However, our understanding of the prevalence of this modification has been fundamentally redefined by transcriptome-wide m6A mapping studies, which have shown that m6A is present in a large subset of the transcriptome in specific regions of mRNA. This suggests that mRNA may undergo post-transcriptional methylation to regulate its fate and function, analogous to methyl modifications in DNA. Thus, the pattern of methylation constitutes an mRNA ‘epitranscriptome’. The identification of adenosine methyltransferases (‘writers’), m6A demethylating enzymes (‘erasers’) and m6A binding proteins (‘readers’) is helping to define cellular pathways for the post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs.},

This modification is reversible and non-stoichiometric and adds another layer to the dynamic control of mRNA metabolism. The stability of m6A-modified mRNA is regulated by an m6A reader protein, human YTHDF2, which recognizes m6A and reduces the stability of target transcripts. Looking at additional functional roles for the modification, we find that anotherm6A reader protein, human YTHDF1, actively promotes protein synthesis by interacting with translation machinery. In a unified mechanism of m6A-based regulation in the cytoplasm, YTHDF2-mediated degradation controls the lifetime of target transcripts, whereas YTHDF1-mediated translation promotion increases translation efficiency, ensuring effective protein production from dynamic transcripts that are marked by m6A. Therefore, the m6A modification in mRNA endows gene expression with fast responses and controllable protein production through these mechanisms.,},

	abstract = {Protein translation typically begins with the recruitment of the 43S ribosomal complex to the 5′ cap of mRNAs by a cap-binding complex. However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in their 5′ UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5′ UTR m6A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5′UTR m6A. Additionally, increased m6A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m6A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5′ UTR m6A. These data show that 5′ UTR m6A bypasses 5′ cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.,},

To explore these questions, we developed conditions to examine N6-adenosine methylase activity in HeLa cell nuclear extracts. Transfer of the methyl group from S-[3H methyl]-adenosylmethionine to unlabeled random copolymer RNA substrates of varying ribonucleotide composition revealed a substrate specificity consistent with a previously deduced consensus sequence, Pu[G greater than A]AC[A/C/U]. 32-P labeled RNA substrates of defined sequence were used to examine the minimum sequence requirements for methylation. Each RNA was 20 nucleotides long, and contained either the core consensus sequence GGACU, or some variation of this sequence. RNAs containing GGACU, either in single or multiple copies, were good substrates for methylation, whereas RNAs containing single base substitutions within the GGACU sequence gave dramatically reduced methylation. These results demonstrate that the N6-adenosine methylase has a strict sequence specificity, and that there is no requirement for extended sequences or secondary structures for methylation. Recognition of this sequence does not require an RNA component, as micrococcal nuclease pretreatment of nuclear extracts actually increased methylation efficiency.},

We describe how adopting nf-core standards enables faster development, improved interoperability, and collaboration with the {\textgreater}8,000 members of the nf-core community. The recent development of Nextflow Domain-Specific Language 2 (DSL2) allows pipeline components to be shared and combined across projects. The nf-core community has harnessed this with a library of modules and subworkflows that can be integrated into any Nextflow pipeline, enabling research communities to progressively transition to nf-core best practices. We present a case study of nf-core adoption by six European research consortia, grouped under the EuroFAANG umbrella and dedicated to farmed animal genomics.

However, those disparate components also increase the probability that the computational experiment fails to be reproducible. Even if software is reproducible today, it may become irreproducible tomorrow without the software itself changing at all, because of the constantly changing software environment in which the software is run. To alleviate irreproducibility, workflow engines integrate with container engines. Additionally, communities that sprung up around workflow engines started to host registries for workflows that follow standards. These standards reduce the effort needed to make workflows automatically reproducible. In this paper, we study automatic reproduction of workflows from two registries, focusing on non-crashing executions. The experimental data lets us analyze the upper bound to which workflow engines could achieve reproducibility. We identify lessons learned in achieving reproducibility in practice.},

Estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) overexpression targeted to mammary epithelial cells in genetically engineered mouse models induces largely similar rates of proliferative mammary disease in prereproductive senescent mice. Herein, with natural reproductive senescence, Esr1 overexpression compared with CYP19A1 overexpression resulted in significantly higher rates of preneoplasia and cancer. Before reproductive senescence, Esr1, but not CYP19A1, overexpressing mice are tamoxifen resistant. However, during reproductive senescence, Esr1 mice exhibited responsiveness. Both Esr1 and CYP19A1 are responsive to letrozole before and after reproductive senescence. Gene Set Enrichment Analyses of RNA-sequencing data sets showed that higher disease rates in Esr1 mice were accompanied by significantly higher expression of cell proliferation genes, including members of prognostic platforms for women with early-stage hormone receptor–positive disease. Tamoxifen and letrozole exposure induced down-regulation of these genes and resolved differences between the two models. Both Esr1 and CYP19A1 overexpression induced abnormal developmental patterns of pregnancy-like gene expression. This resolved with progression through reproductive senescence in CYP19A1 mice, but was more persistent in Esr1 mice, resolving only with tamoxifen and letrozole exposure. In summary, genetically engineered mouse models of Esr1 and CYP19A1 overexpression revealed a diversion of disease processes resulting from the two distinct molecular pathophysiological mammary gland–targeted intrusions into estrogen signaling during reproductive senescence.},

While transcriptome risk profiling is available for human breast cancers, it is not yet developed for prognostication for primary or secondary breast cancer development utilizing at-risk breast tissue. Both estrogen receptor α (ER) and aromatase overexpression have been linked to human breast cancer. Herein, conditional genetically engineered mouse models of estrogen receptor 1 (Esr1) and cytochrome P450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) were used to show that induction of Esr1 overexpression just before or with reproductive senescence and maintained through age 30 months resulted in significantly higher prevalence of estrogen receptor–positive adenocarcinomas than CYP19A1 overexpression. All adenocarcinomas tested showed high percentages of ER+ cells. Mammary cancer development was preceded by a persistent proliferative transcriptome risk signature initiated within 1 week of transgene induction that showed parallels to the Prosigna/Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50 human prognostic signature for early-stage human ER+ breast cancer. CYP19A1 mice also developed ER+ mammary cancers, but histology was more divided between adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous, with one ER– adenocarcinoma. Results demonstrate that, like humans, generation of ER+ adenocarcinoma in mice was facilitated by aging mice past the age of reproductive senescence.
