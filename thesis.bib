Finally, we evaluated the effect of circTADA2A-E6 on miR-203a-3p and its target gene SOCS3. We detected two circRNAs, circTADA2A-E6 and circTADA2A-E5/E6, which were among the top five differentially expressed circRNAs in breast cancer. They were consistently and significantly decreased in a large cohort of breast cancer patients, and their downregulation was associated with poor patient survival for TNBC. Especially, circTADA2A-E6 suppressed in vitro cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity and possessed tumor-suppressor capability. circTADA2A-E6 preferentially acted as a miR-203a-3p sponge to restore the expression of miRNA target gene SOCS3, resulting in a less aggressive oncogenic phenotype. circTADA2As as promising prognostic biomarkers in TNBC patients, and therapeutic targeting of circTADA2As/miRNA/mRNA network may be a potential strategy for the treatment of breast cancer.},

The present study aims to investigate the expression profiles and potential modulation of circRNA on breast cancer carcinogenesis. Human circRNA microarray was performed to screen for abnormally expressed circRNA in breast cancer tissue. Results found circ-ABCB10, was significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissue. And results were replicated in a larger sample size. In vitro, loss-of-function experiments showed circ-ABCB10 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and increased apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Bioinformatics prediction program predicted the complementary sequence within circ-ABCB10 and miR-1271, which was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Finally, miR-1271 rescued the function of circ-ABCB10 on breast cancer cells, confirming the sponge effect of circ-ABCB10 on miR-1271. Overall, results identified a new functional circ-ABCB10 in breast cancer tumorigenesis, and reveal the important regulatory role of circ-ABCB10 through sponging miR-1271, providing a novel insight for breast cancer pathogenesis.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs (circRNAs), which are considered to be important functional regulators in cancer, have provided a new perspective regarding our understanding of tumor biology, including that of breast cancer. To investigate the regulatory effect of circRPPH1 on cellular behaviors of breast cancer and the potential mechanism, the expression of circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p in breast cancer tissues and cell lines were examined by quantitative RT-PCR. The regulatory effects of the circRPPH1/miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis on cellular behaviors of breast cancer cells were evaluated through functional experiments in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. The relationship between circRPPH1 and miR-556-5p/YAP1 was assessed using dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. PCR results showed that circRPPH1 levels were significantly upregulated in tumor tissues and breast cancer cells. Functionally, circRPPH1 promoted the proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of breast cancer cell lines and tumor growth in vivo. Regarding the mechanism, dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays showed that circRPPH1 was capable of sponging miR-556-5p to increase expression of the oncogene YAP1. Our data reveal that circRPPH1 plays a vital regulatory role in breast cancer via the miR-556-5p/YAP1 axis and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Circular RNAs are a large group of noncoding RNAs that are widely expressed in mammalian cells. Genome-wide analyses have revealed abundant and evolutionarily conserved circular RNAs across species, which suggest specific physiological roles of these species. Using a microarray approach, we detected increased expression of a circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 in eight breast cancer cell lines and in patients with breast carcinoma. Silencing circ-Dnmt1 inhibited cell proliferation and survival. Ectopic circ-Dnmt1 increased the proliferative and survival capacities of breast cancer cells by stimulating cellular autophagy. We found that circ-Dnmt1-mediated autophagy was essential in inhibiting cellular senescence and increasing tumor xenograft growth. We further found that ectopically expressed circ-Dnmt1 could interact with both p53 and AUF1, promoting the nuclear translocation of both proteins. Nuclear translocation of p53 induced cellular autophagy while AUF1 nuclear translocation reduced Dnmt1 mRNA instability, resulting in increased Dnmt1 translation. From here, functional Dnmt1 could then translocate into the nucleus, inhibiting p53 transcription. Computational algorithms revealed that both p53 and AUF1 could bind to different regions of circ-Dnmt1 RNA. Our results showed that the highly expressed circular RNA circ-Dnmt1 could bind to and regulate oncogenic proteins in breast cancer cells. Thus circ-Dnmt1 appears to be an oncogenic circular RNA with potential for further preclinical research.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have shown that the occurrence and development of tumours are associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs). However, the expression profile and clinical significance of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours remain unclear. In this paper, we collected tissue samples from three dogs with canine mammary tumours and analysed the expression profiles of circRNAs in these samples using high-throughput sequencing technology. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analyses revealed 14 biological processes associated with these genes, and 11 of these genes were selected for qRT-PCR to verify their authenticity. CircRNAs have sponge adsorption to miRNAs, so we constructed a circRNA-miRNA network map using Cytoscape software. As a result, we identified a total of 14,851 circRNAs in canine mammary tumours and its adjacent normal tissues. Of these, 106 were differentially expressed (fold change ≥ 2, p ≤ 0.05), and 64 were upregulated and 42 were downregulated. The GO analysis revealed that the biological processes involved were mainly in the regulation of the secretory pathway, the regulation of neurotransmitter secretion and the positive regulation of phagocytosis. Most of these biological pathways were associated with the cGMP-PKG (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signalling pathway, the cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signalling pathway and the oxytocin signalling pathway. After screening, source genes closely associated with canine mammary tumours were found to include RYR2, PDE4D, ROCK2, CREB3L2 and UBA3, and associated circRNAs included chr27:26618544-26687235-, chr26:8194880-8201833+ and chr17:7960861-7967766-. In conclusion, we reveals the expression profile of circRNAs in canine mammary tumours. In addition, some circRNAs might be used as potential biomarkers for molecular diagnosis.},

Available estimates demonstrate that breast cancer incidence and mortality are rising in LMICs, including in Africa, although high-quality data from LMICs (and particularly from sub-Saharan Africa) are largely lacking. Case fatality rates from breast cancer appear to be substantially higher in LMICs than in high-income countries. Significant challenges exist to developing breast cancer control programs in LMICs, perhaps particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and the most effective strategies for treatment and early detection in the context of limited resources are uncertain. High-quality research on breast cancer incidence and mortality and implementation research to guide effective breast cancer control strategies in LMICs are urgently needed. Enhanced investment in breast cancer research and treatment in LMICs should be a global public health priority.},

	abstract = {Objectives: This study is a systematic review of literature published up to May of 2010 aimed to identify relationships between dietary fat, and fat subtypes, with risk of breast cancer in women. Methods: Descriptive data, estimates of relative risk and associated 95\% confidence interval (CI) were extracted from relative studies and analyzed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Cohort study results indicated significant summary relative risks between polyunsaturated fat and breast cancer (1.091, 95\% CI: 1.001; 1.184). In case-control studies no association between fat and breast cancer was observed. Post-menopausal women indicated a significant association between total fat (1.042, 95\%CI: 1.013; 1.073), PUFA intake (1.22, 95\% CI: 1.08; 1.381), and breast cancer. A non-significant inverse relation between intake of all fat types and breast cancer was identified in premenopausal women. Conclusions: These results support the idea that possible elevations in serum estrogen levels by an adult exposure to a high-fat diet would increase breast cancer risk. Furthermore, menopausal status was observed to affect women's risk of breast cancer. Higher risks of breast cancer were found in post-menopausal women consuming diets high in total fat and polyunsaturated fats. Conversely, dietary fat appears to have preventative effects in pre-menopausal women. This study takes a transformative approach combining epidemiological, biomedical, and evolutionary theory to evaluate how biocultural variations in risk factors (i.e., diet and reproduction) affect the evolution of breast cancers.

The etiology of breast cancer is attributed to a complex interaction between various modifiable and non-modifiable factors. This etiology is determined by genetics, environmental, nutritional, hormonal, and heritable elements that contribute to the development of this disease. Risk factors include prior history of breast cancer, positive family history, obesity, tall stature, smoking, alcohol consumption, early menarche, late menopause, sedentary lifestyle, nulliparity and hormone replacement therapy. Factors associated with decreased risk of breast cancer include multiparity, history of breastfeeding, physical activity, weight loss, and prophylactic surgical and medical interventions. \&nbsp;In the United States, approximately one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. This disease is more common in white, post-menopausal females. Risk increases with older age with about 80\% of breast cancer patients being older than 50 years. Analyzing the etiology of breast cancer allows for the development of improved screening and treatment interventions. In this chapter, the etiology of breast cancer along with the risk factors associated with this disease are discussed.},

The authors evaluated associations of hormone-related factors with breast cancer subtypes in a population-based case-control study involving 1,409 ER-positive (ER+)/PR-positive (PR+) cases, 712 ER-negative (ER−)/PR-negative (PR−) cases, 301 ER+/PR− cases, 254 ER−/PR+ cases, and 3,474 controls aged 20–70 years in Shanghai, China (phase I, 1996–1998; phase II, 2002–2005). Polytomous logistic regression and Wald tests for heterogeneity across subtypes were conducted. Breast cancer risks associated with age at menarche, age at menopause, breastfeeding, age at first livebirth, waist-to-hip ratio, and oral contraceptive use did not differ by hormone receptor status. Among postmenopausal women, higher parity (≥2 children vs. 1) was associated with reduced risk (odds ratio (OR) = 0.69, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.52, 0.91) and higher body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)2) with increased risk (highest quartile: OR = 2.40, 95\% CI: 1.65, 3.47) of the ER+/PR+ subtype but was unrelated to the ER−/PR− subtype (for parity, Pheterogeneity = 0.02; for BMI, Pheterogeneity \&lt; 0.01). Hormone replacement therapy (OR = 2.25, 95\% CI: 1.40, 3.62) and alcohol consumption (OR = 1.59, 95\% CI: 1.01, 2.51) appeared to be preferentially associated with the ER+/PR− subtype. These findings indicate that BMI, parity, hormone replacement therapy, and alcohol consumption may play different roles in subtypes of breast cancer. More research is needed to better understand the etiology of 2 relatively rare subtypes, ER+/PR− tumors and ER−/PR+ tumors.},

	abstract = {Hyperprolactinemia, defined as a sustained elevation of prolactin (PRL) levels greater than 530 mIU/L in women and greater than 424 mIU/L in men, has been implicated for a long time in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Elevated PRL values (approximately 2-3 times higher than the reference values) are a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with first-generation drugs, and most antipsychotics carry a standard warning regarding PRL elevations on their US product labels. These associations foster undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses in both otherwise healthy patients and cancer patients. This review assesses both the preclinical and clinical evidence that has led to the hypothesis of PRL's role in breast cancer risk or breast cancer progression. It is concluded that taken together, the published data are unconvincing and insufficient to deprive cancer patients in general and breast cancer patients specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic or antidepressant medications for serious psychiatric indications. We thus call on revised medication guidelines to avoid the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses among cancer patients based on an unproven contraindication to psychiatric medications.

	abstract = {Breast cancer mortality rates in South Carolina (SC) are 40 \% higher among African-American (AA) than European-American (EA) women. Proposed reasons include race-associated variations in care and/or tumor characteristics, which may be subject to income effects. We evaluated race-associated differences in tumor biologic phenotype and stage among low-income participants in a government-funded screening program. Best Chance Network (BCN) data were linked with the SC Central Cancer Registry. Characteristics of breast cancers diagnosed in BCN participants aged 47–64 years during 1996–2006 were abstracted. Race-specific case proportions and incidence rates based on estrogen receptor (ER) status and histologic grade were estimated. Among 33,880 low-income women accessing BCN services, repeat breast cancer screening utilization was poor, especially among EAs. Proportionally, stage at diagnosis did not differ by race (607 cancers, 53 \% among AAs), with about 40 \% advanced stage. Compared to EAs, invasive tumors in AAs were 67 \% more likely (proportions) to be of poor-prognosis phenotype (both ER-negative and high-grade); this was more a result of the 46 \% lesser AA incidence (rates) of better-prognosis (ER+ lower-grade) cancer than the 32 \% greater incidence of poor-prognosis disease (p values {\textless}0.01). When compared to the general SC population, racial disparities in poor-prognostic features within the BCN population were attenuated; this was due to more frequent adverse tumor features in EAs rather than improvements for AAs. Among low-income women in SC, closing the breast cancer racial and income mortality gaps will require improved early diagnosis, addressing causes of racial differences in tumor biology, and improved care for cancers of poor-prognosis biology.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the major public health issues and is considered a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Its early diagnosis can effectively help in increasing the chances of survival rate. To this end, biopsy is usually followed as a gold standard approach in which tissues are collected for microscopic analysis. However, the histopathological analysis of breast cancer is non-trivial, labor-intensive, and may lead to a high degree of disagreement among pathologists. Therefore, an automatic diagnostic system could assist pathologists to improve the effectiveness of diagnostic processes. This paper presents an ensemble deep learning approach for the definite classification of non-carcinoma and carcinoma breast cancer histopathology images using our collected dataset. We trained four different models based on pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19 architectures. Initially, we followed 5-fold cross-validation operations on all the individual models, namely, fully-trained VGG16, fine-tuned VGG16, fully-trained VGG19, and fine-tuned VGG19 models. Then, we followed an ensemble strategy by taking the average of predicted probabilities and found that the ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and fine-tuned VGG19 performed competitive classification performance, especially on the carcinoma class. The ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and VGG19 models offered sensitivity of 97.73\% for carcinoma class and overall accuracy of 95.29\%. Also, it offered an F1 score of 95.29\%. These experimental results demonstrated that our proposed deep learning approach is effective for the automatic classification of complex-natured histopathology images of breast cancer, more specifically for carcinoma images.},

Living far from health services is known to delay presentation, but the effect of residential distance to hospital, the radius at which this effect sets in and the women most affected have not been quantified. In a periurban South African setting, we examined the effect of a geographic information system (GIS)-measured straight-line distance, from a patient's residence to diagnostic hospital, on stage at diagnosis in 1,071 public-sector breast cancer patients diagnosed during 2006–2012. Generalized linear models were used to estimate risk ratios for late stage (stage III/IV vs. stage I/II) associated with distance, adjusting for year of diagnosis, age, race and socioeconomic indicators. Mean age of patients was 55 years, 90\% were black African and diagnoses were at stages I (5\%), II (41\%), III (46\%) and IV (8\%). Sixty-two percent of patients with distances {\textgreater}20 km (n = 338) had a late stage at diagnosis compared to 50\% with distances {\textless}20 km (n = 713, p = 0.02). Risk of late stage at diagnosis was 1.25-fold higher (95\% CI: 1.09, 1.42) per 30 km. Effects were pronounced in an underrepresented group of patients over age 70. This positive stage–distance association held to 40 km, and plateaued or slightly reversed in patients (9\%) living beyond this distance. Studies of woman and the societal and healthcare-level influences on these delays and on the late stage at diagnosis distribution are needed to inform interventions to improve diagnostic stage and breast cancer survival in this and similar settings.},

	abstract = {Objective To compare the survival rates of women with BRCA associated breast cancer who did and did not undergo mastectomy of the contralateral breast.
Design Retrospective analysis.
Setting 12 cancer genetics clinics.
Participants 390 women with a family history of stage I or II breast cancer who were carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and initially treated with unilateral or bilateral mastectomy. 181 patients had mastectomy of the contralateral breast. Patients were followed for up to 20 years from diagnosis.
Main outcome measure Death from breast cancer.
Results 79 women died of breast cancer in the follow-up period (18 in the bilateral mastectomy group and 61 in the unilateral mastectomy group). The median follow-up time was 14.3 years (range 0.1-20.0 years). At 20 years the survival rate for women who had mastectomy of the contralateral breast was 88\% (95\% confidence interval 83\% to 93\%) and for those who did not was 66\% (59\% to 73\%). In a multivariable analysis, controlling for age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, treatment, and other prognostic features, contralateral mastectomy was associated with a 48\% reduction in death from breast cancer (hazard ratio 0.52, 95\% confidence interval 0.29 to 0.93; P=0.03). In a propensity score adjusted analysis of 79 matched pairs, the association was not significant (0.60, 0.34 to 1.06; P=0.08). Based on these results, we predict that of 100 women treated with contralateral mastectomy, 87 will be alive at 20 years compared with 66 of 100 women treated with unilateral mastectomy.
Conclusions This study suggests that women who are positive for BRCA mutations and who are treated for stage I or II breast cancer with bilateral mastectomy are less likely to die from breast cancer than women who are treated with unilateral mastectomy. Given the small number of events in this cohort, further research is required to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Estrogen signaling pathways have been identified as efficient targets of breast cancer therapy, given their key role in promoting breast tumor growth. Agents blocking estrogen-mediated pathways are routinely used in clinical applications in patients displaying estrogen-sensitive breast cancer subtypes; however intrinsic or acquired resistance to treatment often occurs or develops, thus limiting their efficacy. This limitation has highlighted an imperative need to identify new predictive biomarkers. Recent findings have highlighted a role for the Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in breast cancer tumorigenesis. LKB1 is a serine/threonine kinase mutated in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), implicated in many cellular processes including energy metabolism, cell polarization and cell cycle arrest and has also been shown to play an essential role as a tumor suppressor gene by negatively regulating the mTOR pathway. This review provides an overview of previous findings and ongoing research on LKB1, and substantiates the use of this kinase as a potential prognostic and predictive biomarker of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Both estrogen, through the estrogen receptor (ER), and growth factors, through the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, have been shown to independently promote cell survival. Here, we investigated the role of ER/PI3K-AKT crosstalk in the regulation of cell survival in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells. The ER inhibitor ICI 182,780 was used to determine the requirement of the ER for estrogen in the suppression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) induced apoptosis. Gene reporter assays and Western blot analyses were used to determine the involvement of the pro-survival factor Bcl-2 and the coactivator GRIP1 in this survival crosstalk. We demonstrated that an intact ER signaling pathway was required for estrogen to suppress apoptosis induced by TNFα. Our gene reporter assays revealed that ERα, not ERβ, was targeted by AKT, resulting in transcriptional potentiation of the full-length Bcl-2 promoter, ultimately leading to increased Bcl-2 protein levels. AKT targeted both activation function (AF) domains of the ERα for maximal induction of Bcl-2 reporter activity, although the AF-II domain was predominately targeted. In addition, AKT also caused an upregulation of GRIP1 protein levels. Finally, AKT and GRIP1 cooperated to increase Bcl-2 protein expression to a greater level than either factor alone. Collectively, our study suggests a role for ER/PI3K-AKT crosstalk in cell survival and documents the ability of AKT to regulate Bcl-2 expression via differential activation of ERα and ERβ as well as regulation of GRIP1.},

	abstract = {The breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) play important roles in breast cancer occurrence, recurrence and metastasis. However, the role of estrogen signaling, a signaling pathway important in development and progression of breast cancer, in regulation of BCSC has not been well established. Previously, we identified and cloned a variant of estrogen receptor α, ER-α36, with a molecular weight of 36 kDa. ER-α36 lacks both transactivation domains AF-1 and AF-2 of the 66 kDa full-length ER-α (ER-α66) and mediates rapid estrogen signaling to promote proliferation of breast cancer cells. In this study, we aim to investigate the function and the underlying mechanism of ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling in growth regulation of the ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. ER-positive breast cancer cells MCF7 and T47D as well as the variants with different levels of ER-α36 expression were used. The effects of estrogen on BCSC's abilities of growth, self-renewal, differentiation and tumor-seeding were examined using tumorsphere formation, flow cytometry, indirect immunofluorence staining and in vivo xenograft assays. The underlying mechanisms were also studied with Western-blot analysis. We found that 17-β-estradiol (E2β) treatment increased the population of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells while failed to do so in the cells with knocked-down levels of ER-α36 expression. Cells with forced expression of recombinant ER-α36, however, responded strongly to E2β treatment by increasing growth in vitro and tumor-seeding efficiency in vivo. The rapid estrogen signaling via the AKT/GSK3β pathway is involved in estrogen-stimulated growth of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells. We concluded that ER-α36-mediated rapid estrogen signaling plays an important role in regulation and maintenance of ER-positive breast cancer stem/progenitor cells.},

	abstract = {It is prevailingly thought that estrogen signaling is not involved in development of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. However, there is evidence indicating that ovariectomy prevents the development of both ER-positive and -negative breast cancer, suggesting that estrogen signaling is involved in the development of ER-negative breast cancer. Previously, our laboratory cloned a variant of ER-α, ER-α36, and found that ER-α36 mediated nongenomic estrogen signaling and is highly expressed in ER-negative breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that ER-α36 was highly expressed in 10/12 cases of triple-negative breast cancer. We investigated the role of mitogenic estrogen signaling mediated by ER-α36 in malignant growth of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-436 cells that express high levels of ER-α36 and found that these cells strongly responded to mitogenic estrogen signaling both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of ER-α36 expression in these cells using the small hairpin RNA method diminished their responsiveness to estrogen. ER-α36 physically interacted with the EGFR/Src/Shc complex and mediated estrogen-induced phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Src. EGFR signaling activated ER-α36 transcription through an AP1 site in the ER-α36 promoter, and ER-α36 expression was able to stabilize EGFR protein. Our results, thus demonstrated that ER-α36 mediates nongenomic estrogen signaling through the EGFR/Src/ERK signaling pathway in ER-negative breast cancer cells and suggested that a subset of ER-negative breast tumors that expresses ER-α36, retains responsiveness to mitogenic estrogen signaling.},

	abstract = {The identification of novel prognostic biomarkers for breast cancer is an unmet clinical need. Cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) has been implicated in mediating carcinogenesis in prostate and lung cancers. In addition, CAND1 is an established prognostic biomarker for worse prognosis in liver cancer. However, the prognostic significance of CAND1 in breast cancer has not yet been explored. In this study, Breast Cancer Gene-Expression Miner (Bc-GenExMiner) and TIMER2.0 were utilized to explore the mRNA expression of CAND1 in ERα-positive breast cancer patients. The Kaplan–Meier plotter was used to explore the relationship between CAND1 expression and several prognostic indicators. The Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) web server was then used to explore the pathways of the genes that correlate with CAND1 in ERα-positive breast cancer. Immune infiltration was investigated using Bc-GenExMiner. Our bioinformatics analysis illustrates that breast cancer patients have higher CAND1 compared to normal breast tissue and that ERα-positive breast cancer patients with a high expression of CAND1 have poor overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) outcomes. Higher CAND1 expression was observed in histologic grade 3 compared to grades 2 and 1. Our results revealed that CAND1 positively correlates with lymph nodes and negatively correlates with the infiltration of immune cells, which is in agreement with published reports. Our findings suggest that CAND1 might mediate invasion and metastasis in ERα-positive breast cancer, possibly through the activation of estrogen and androgen signaling pathways; however, experiments should be carried out to further explore the role of CAND1 in activating the androgen and estrogen signaling pathways. In conclusion, the results suggest that CAND1 could be used as a potential novel biomarker for worse prognosis in ERα-positive breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Many tumors contain heterogeneous populations of cells, only some of which exhibit increased tumorigenicity and resistance to anticancer therapies. Evidence suggests that these aggressive cancer cells, often termed “cancer stem cells” or “cancer stem-like cells” (CSCs), rely upon developmental signaling pathways that are important for survival and expansion of normal stem cells. Here we report that, in analogy to embryonic mammary epithelial biology, estrogen signaling expands the pool of functional breast CSCs through a paracrine FGF/FGFR/Tbx3 signaling pathway. Estrogen or FGF9 pretreatment induced CSC properties of breast cancer cell lines and freshly isolated breast cancer cells, whereas cotreatment of cells with tamoxifen or a small molecule inhibitor of FGFR signaling was sufficient to prevent the estrogen-induced expansion of CSCs. Furthermore, reduction of FGFR or Tbx3 gene expression was able to abrogate tumorsphere formation, whereas ectopic Tbx3 expression increased tumor seeding potential by 100-fold. These findings demonstrate that breast CSCs are stimulated by estrogen through a signaling pathway that similarly controls normal mammary epithelial stem cell biology.},
